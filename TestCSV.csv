We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference I have to say normally I am very easy going about amenities cleanliness and the likehowever our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review Truly DO NOT stay at this hotel When we arrived in our room it was clear that the carpet hadnt been vacuumed I figuered okay its just the carpet Until I saw the bathroom Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned ie a paper band across the toilet paper caps on the drinking glasses etc it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place There was a spot probably urine on the toilet seat and I kid you not the remnants of a lipsmudge on the glass I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things appear clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary Well the Hilton was proof I called downstairs and complained and they sent up a chambermaid hours later Frankly I found the room disgusting The hotel itself outside the rooms was cavernous and unwelcoming with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraineinducing din Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this When I got home I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not such was the skeeviness of our accomodations Please do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel,negative,false
Hotel is located 12 mile from the train station which is quite hike when youre traveling with luggage andor kids They seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parkingvalet fees Rooms feature either double or king sized beds no queen beds at all If you want a little extra leg room in your bed the price jump from double to kingsized is stiff Rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge too,negative,false
I made my reservation at the Hilton Chicago believing I was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities Unfortunately my stay at the Hilton Chicago went downhill from the moment I checked in There was only one clerk at the front desk and several guests already waiting ahead of me Once I finally got checked in and located my room I discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk Finally I made it into my room It appeared nice enough until I went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged The manager moved me into a new room so I cant complain too much but still it was a hassle Finally settled I was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning That is  until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call I had not requested Needless to say my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and I will choose other accommodations for my next trip to Chicago,negative,false
When most people think Hilton they think luxury I know I did I only wish Id been half right Upon arriving I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely Not a very auspicious start but they did find me another room Granted the new room had an ohsoscenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building But fine I was willing to let this slide I didnt want to be difficult In the following days of my stay it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term luxury hotel Noisy neighbors Rude staff If the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout I doubt my sheets were changed even once Next time Ill ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper The service couldnt possibly be worse,negative,false
My husband and I recently stayed stayed at the Hilton Chicago and it was a horrible experience When we arrived the front desk clerk was on the phone on what sounded like a personal call and didnt even acknowledge us for at least five minutes When we got to our room I went to lay on the bed and noticed a black hair on the pillow Im am very paranoid about hotels being dirty so I pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs I called for some new sheets which they said they would send right up but it actually took nearly 30 minutes The second night we were there we decided to try the Irish pub in the hotel called Kitty OSheas because my husband loves pub food We had the shepherds pie which was awful It was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap Our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check While we had a great trip to Chicago the Hilton was definitely NOT a highlight of our trip Overall we had rude service a dirty room and bad food Spend your money elsewhere,negative,false
My wife and I booked a room at the Hilton Chicago three weekends ago as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel We were expecting some minutia of luxury However this was not the case with the Hilton Chicago First we had reserved a room with a king size bed but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed Now we did get a reduced price because of this but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked Second we had to change our room key twice The room keys they used supposedly lost their charge This is what the front desk told us So we had to go up to our room find out the key didnt work then come back down stairs get a new key then get back in This was highly unprofessional and they really need to look into their key system Lastly we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room We knew this was accurate but I always check just in case But two weeks later when I checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card I had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card Suffice it to say we will not be staying there again,negative,false
For a hotel rated with four diamonds by AAA one would think the Hilton Chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty The only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare I should have known from the moment I walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth First off as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who couldnt be any older than nineteen or twenty red flags started going up The clerk was extremely rude and lazy acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone If that wasnt bad enough the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wifes breasts She wasnt even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat After diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys It shouldnt have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break Okay that was annoying but we managed easy enough We finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip To our surprise not to mention our disgust and horror their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out It took almost a half hour between the couple in the room the front desk and my wife and me to get it straightened out Apparently the night clerk didnt bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk After what could only be described as chaos we were finally given another room on the next floor up We were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while I dropped our luggage by the beds Hearing a clinking sound I bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed I was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when I heard my wife cry out There on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and I noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there There in the sink and in very plain sight was a used condom So far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back By then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room free of charge to make up for our troubles The room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around Despite being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had we decided to make due So while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip I pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access I shouldnt have even bothered as Ive used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds I was getting With a quick call to the desk I was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment So instead of worrying about it we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area Yet again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wifes chest or forgot half of our order After arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything we found that our found was not only bland it was cold We didnt even bother trying anything else that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel I dont know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who couldnt clean a room but I know that that hotel didnt deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative That place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel,negative,false
I had high hopes for the Hilton Chicago but I am sad to say that I am disapointed Not only is it outrageously expensive over 200 for two people for one night but they expect you to pay over 40 to park your car They do not offer free WiFi but instead I had to pay 20 to get on the internet in my room I had to wait until 3 pm to check in even though my flight was in the morning and I had to rent a car at the airport because the hotel did not offer transportation too and from After all of this stress the Hilton Chicago didnt have an in hotel bar either I doubt I will stay here again,negative,false
We booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend but upon arrival our reservation could not be found I even provided the hotel with our confirmation number but it still wasnt available Fortunately another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us Once we settled into our room for the night after a long flight there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom Apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to reclean it after our arrival Needless to say with both of these poor experiences in just one night I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again let alone any other Hilton around Please consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago,negative,false
Ive stayed at other hotels in Chicago but this was the first absolutely horrifying experience First off the staff was incredibly rude I could have lived with that being that it was busy but when the person would not get off their cell phone while a was checking in it had me wanting to pull my hair out The room was also horrid It smelled like sex and cigar smoke so bad in there that I was convinced a politician had just checked out after using it for a cheap affair There was also what looked to be dried snot on the shower curtain Mark my words Never again will I stay at this dump,negative,false
During my stay at the Hilton Chicago it has been quite unpleasant How so you might ask? Well ill tell you the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible I mean they werent even at the desk when I checked in Also When I ordered my breakfast lunch and dinner from room service I received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch Finally The bill was charging me for stuff I didnt want or ask for But overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others I give it a half a star,negative,false
I stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago That was the last time I will be staying there When I arrived I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking They wanted at least 10 What am I paying for when I stay there for the night? The website also touted the clean linens The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean The problem was with all of the down pillows etc Dont they know that people have allergies? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets I think that this was another part of my symptoms If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking Beware hidden costs I will try somewhere else in the future Not worth the money or the sneezing all night,negative,false
The Hilton Chicago located on prime real estate in downtown Chicago has not aged as gracefully as other hotels around the country opened during the same period of time The hotel does maintain the appearance of luxury that has made it iconic but that luxury is not in accord with 21st century standards Lacking any form of fitness center the Hilton is almost alone among the major hotels of Chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a quick workout Even nominal fees for wireless internet use in hotel rooms is very rare at this point and the outrageous parking fee of 43 for guests will discourage out of towners from making the Hilton their destination Most guest rooms are no different than any other Hilton anywhere meaning that unless you are staying in the admittedly fantastic Executive suites you will be paying a premium for a prosaic hotel experience,negative,false
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July For a luxury hotel this place did not meet my expectations For starters we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldnt be ready for at least another hour Im used to hotel rooms being ready well before checkin timee Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotels restaurants Kitty OSheas Well we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks Once we finally got to our room it was OK although not great for the price We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view and there were not extra towels as I had requested We had to call room service twice to receive them then another two times because our air conditioner wasnt working Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone Next time Im in the Chicago area I wont be staying at the Hilton Id only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money,negative,false
The Hilton Chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel There are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from King with two bathrooms Lakeside view or suites It only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill You will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return The staff is nice but when I stay at a hotel I do not go out of my way to seek out the staff The casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap Next time I stay in Chicago I will be looking elsewhere,negative,false
My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton We were looking for a quit few days away from home and work Unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for First of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos The floors looked like they havent been cleaned in a while in the check in area The room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side The staff was horrible We had asked for a turn down service it was never received I would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone Chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton,negative,false
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a recent business trip I elected to go with their Executive Suite upgrade All I can say is What upgrade? Its barely anything above what you get normally And for the price I paid I was expecting much better acommodations Because I arrived around 1030 the night I checked in delayed flight I did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10 I find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when youre expecting a guest who has not checked in yet Beyond that it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room First it was a room mixup then it was a missing key card That was extremely frustrating as I was tired and I had a presentation to give the next morning Speaking of the next morning the complimentary breakfast was a joke When I just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast Ill stay at the next Super 8 I find And the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed I will not be staying at the Hilton Chicago every again even though I frequent Chicago This tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot,negative,false
I really wish I could say that I liked this hotel but the whole experience was just plain awful My first warning sign should have been when I made my reservation The person I spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing At first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel I was actually wanting he booked me for the wrong dates He read me the right dates and it was only when I called back two days later to confirm that I found out hed given me the wrong dates Hilton did get it fixed but I already had a bad feeling about my stay Then came actually staying at the hotel The people at the checkin desk were downright rude Then there was the room I was supposed to be in a nonsmoking room but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke The hotel staff refused to believe me but did let me change rooms to one that didnt smell of cigarettes However I might as well have stayed in the first room I was short towels and it took four callsover a period of 12 hours to the front desk to get some The sheets had not been changed made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them Yes I was able to get fresh sheets but like the towels it took several hours for them to be delivered Since this is a pet friendly hotel lucky me I got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs The walls were so paper thin all I could hear all night was barking When I complained about it the staff refused to believe me and said that the walls of the room are so thick I shouldnt be able to hear anything from next door Yeah right I was excited to use the pool but just like my room it hadnt been cleaned recently Then I tried the fitness center Half the equipment was broken I tried to cut my stay short but of course this hotel wouldnt work with me at all They even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness I had to deal with I will never stay with Hilton again and I will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was,negative,false
My family stayed at this hotel and walking into the Lobby I expected a very good experience Once I made my way to the counter and was Greeted Not Really I knew this may be a bad experience The Customer Service Person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes Once I got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out The High Chair that we requested still had spots of food on it The Rest Room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper After we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid Luckily we only had to stay there one day One day was almost too long,negative,false
I was very disappointed with this hotel The front desk clerk was rude she was on a personal call and took 10 mins to get off the phone When I arrived in the room the bed wasnt made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty I called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignmenton the twelveth floor Once downstairs the clerk treated me as though I had done something wrong When I arrived in the new room I found the bathroom less than clean There was hair all over the floor toilet and shower The shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror My allergies started to bother me immediately upon entering the room so I checked the filter in the air conditioner Which looked like it had never been cleanedThe comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum While waiting on acceptable room I went to dinner Which proved to be as bad as the rooms The lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy The steak was rare and I asked for medium Not to mention it tasted like rotten meatThe veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry To top the whole experience off When I went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay,negative,false
When I went to The James hotel in Chicago I truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising Gorgeous chairs staff at the desk focusing on their job and a clean well decorated hotel room Much to my and my wallets dismay I found quite the opposite I arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed and found the clerk reading a magazine It must have been a fascinating article as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if I had a reservation or would be making one I said I had one and gave him the voucher Id printed out He checked it and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out he went on to say that I would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if I wished to stay the night I grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and I desperately needed to get some sleep The clerk offered to walk me to my room saying I looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after I got some sleep I accepted and followed him to my new room He carried the briefcase I had with me but it was not apparent why at the time as I had both hands free He ushered me into my room setting the briefcase down inside and said if I needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything I thanked him and closed the door It was then that I looked around and fully saw where I was staying What was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6 apart covered in ruffled blankets and sheets The cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently A quick look around the other areas and I found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap not even the complementary ones were left behind I got ready for bed and looked around for the TV remote which it turned out had no batteries in it Instead I just turned out the lights and rolled over sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option In the morning I walked down to the lobby and asked to check out Id had enough of the hotel after one night The clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill 240 for my room and an extra 80 with a note about a baggage service I asked her about it and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service I asked if it was considered reasonable to charge 80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up and riding the elevator and she said it was unusual but not unheard of She offered to change it to a mere 20 and handed me a slip with a phone number name and reason for the disagreement saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and I after I signed it I did so and left my wallet 260 lighter and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep,negative,false
I recently stayed in The James Hotel in Chicago and trust me I will never do it again When you pay a premium price youd expect first rate service Our whole experience was a disaster though short lived bc we could stay their another second When we arrived at the hotel we had to wait while the receptionist finished playing with her phone for service and then our room was not ready So we had to wait in the lobby with our baggage When we finally got to the room I wouldnt exactly call it clean but it wasnt to bad The pictures on the website are nice enough but the furniture is falling apart and probably from Walmart There was plenty of space for an average person of 5 but Im 64 and the beds where smaller than what they said not to mention uncomfortable We ordered room service and not only did they bring us the wrong order but it took 2 hours There walls were also paper thin so we got little sleep The heater helped block out some noise until it stopped working in the middle of the night So the next morning sore from the uncomfortable bed hungry tired and cold we checked out before we even had our coffee Stay away,negative,false
I was disappointed in my stay at The James I am on a strict gluten free diet and was told the hotel restaurant could accomodate my needs Each time I sat down for a meal I would explain my dietary needs to the waiter Most times I ended up having to send the plate back because some gluten item was included My wife has sleep apnea and when we made our reservations I made sure to ask if there was a room available with an outlet near the bed so that she could plug in her CPAP machine I was assured that this was no problem However when we arrived at the hotel we had to request a room change because there was no outlet near the bed We had to wait in the lobby for sometime because the room we were moved to was not yet finished benig cleaned Overall it was not an entirely horrific stay but I expected more out of a hotel of this supposed caliber Next time I visit Chicago I will be staying at another hotel,negative,false
I was initially excited when I found out that my employer was sending me to Chicago on business but I could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of The James Chicago When I arrived my reservation could not be found in their system although I had made it myself After some words with the manager on duty Mr Chad Montgomery I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate Anyone can make a mistake so I wasnt too angry at that point My room was bland and colorless in spite of The James boasts of their attention to design and detail The room was mostly clean but after seeing the stains on the bedding I am not convinced that they were washed after the rooms last occupant I attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy disgruntled waitstaff Afterward I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order I was assured that I would enjoy Ashas Purifying Shower Ritual which would primarily take place in my own room The shower was okay but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided because I broke out in hives all over my body Next came the inroom portion While I was in the shower five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room I guess they were supposed to make it smell good but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room My masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking I am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu In closing if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago I beg of you to reconsider With only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel and a suitcase full of negative including a pending court case against the masseuse I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there I know I do,negative,false
James Chicago would be one of the worst hotels I have ever been to in my life Even though i noticed that the design of the place was extremely artistic its service quality and hotel conditions were horrible They gave me a room in which the blankets were dirty and looked as if it been used just moments ago I figured it was because the hotel was busy but I started to notice that the furniture came with a cost in service The television was not working at all I was extremely disapointed especially when coming from a rigorous day of work and just wanting to relax Sadly i settled in doing my work instead of frittering my time doing noting when i got the next disapointment The Wifi was a bust Absolutely nothing to do but to stare at the furniture or just stare at the wall I am never going to James Hotel ever again,negative,false
James Chicago the luxurious nice hotel as it was advertised I didnt want stay in this hotel but my wife insisted Ok so when I booked the ticket it cost me 299 for one room 299 I could get a new honeycomb android tablet with dual core processor at that price point The room was stylish though it looked nice There was a TV and the beds were fine Although I couldnt quite understand why they had Wifi and no computer Why would I even need wifi if there is no computer? What were they thinking? The experience I had with James Chicago was a bit below of what I had expected I mean the food available there wasnt very tasty at all I had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and I was also hoping to browse the internet but they had no computer only wifi Thats like only having bread without any fillings to make it into a sandwich,negative,false
DO NOT STAY HERE My wife and I were visiting family in Chicago and decided to stay at the James We had stayed at the James in New York happily so we came in with good expectations What a mistake Our room looked nothing like the ones pictured on the website The bathroom was dirty and the bedding and furniture were disheveled There was also a musty odor to the room When we called the front desk to complain they were quite rude We ended up leaving and staying in a different hotel for the duration of our stay,negative,false
A recent stay at the James HotelChicago revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only Although the rooms and public areas look nice the hotel still needs serious work Our first room was not clean when we arrived and this nonsmoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke We asked for a new room which was clean and odor free We had to involve the Manager before our request was granted The new room was better at first glance but was severely lacking We could not get the temperature properly regulated The room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay In a hotel commanding the rates of the James we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted not something which is a constant battle Our mattress was horribly uncomfortable When the rooms were updated the James skipped new mattresses Ours was worn to the point of having indentations you cant get out ofwhen you lie down you sort of sink into a hole This matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a luxury hotel Last but not least we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay In spite of the calming decor the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good nights sleep All in all we were unhappy with our accommodations at the James Chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location You will be happier almost anywhere else,negative,false
The hotel was not one of the better ones I stayed at the room was seemingly nice at first but after staying there for a few days it seemed like the cleaning staff never came through to clean it I had the same sheets for a three days before I called and requested they be changed Also the walls seem to be paper thin and you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms which interfered with my sleep I ate at the primehouse in the restaurant also and asked for a well done steak and the steak was still pretty pink on the inside and lacked flavor This is definitely not a hotel I would recommend to anyone,negative,false
I had a business trip coming up in Chicago and I wanted to stay someplace really nice cause I had never been there so made reservations with the James two weeks in advance just to be on the safe side and when I arrived they had no record of it No big deal right? They said they would take care of it and get me a room right away two hours later Im still sitting in the lobby Finally I get to my room to try and relax Everything was nice until I decided to take a shower I went into the bathroom no towels wash cloths nothing I called down to the front desk and asked for some about an hour later someone came up with one Maybe they were just really busy? Finally I get in the shower and the handle is BROKEN I went down to the front desk and asked for a new room and they started implying that I broke it They said everything was fine with the room earlier that day and that I must have done something to it Leaving that hotel was the easiest decision I made on my whole trip Two thumbs down,negative,false
The James Hotel in Chicago looks nice on the website but looks can be deceiving The employees are extremely rude and the rooms are disgusting I would definitely advise against staying there,negative,false
The James Chicago hotel was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in The only good thing about it was that it was located downtown so I wasnt forced to stay in it any longer than I had to The receptionist was rude and snobby my room had dirty towels in it and i found numerous small insects in my room Furthermore the gym and spa were closed while I was there Nothing was done by management to accommodate me for these inconveniences Next time I will take my business elsewhere,negative,false
I was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the James I had heard from others that it was agreeable and workable and all right or even a nice place I figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my longdistance girlfriend According to the website I was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cuttingedge contemporary furnishings and warm tones Well when I arrived I felt like I was in an Ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day Everything in the front was just a bit too askew The staff were busy distracted inattentive and in every way keen to show me I was a bother to them I handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort I also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price It looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before I got there The bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly inexplicably of mens cologne Nobody cared when I complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just stuck in my nose and that it would go away Well it didnt and I had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived This ruined my entire first evening in Chicago For my price I could have stayed a week at an economy hotel gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs and still saved money And I would not have been treated like such a pest Needless to say I will be looking elsewhere when I go back to Chicago I may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels but I know when I am wasting my money,negative,false
When you stay at a hotel like The James just from their price point you expect a certain level of quality If I pay well over 500 dollars for a room I do not think it unreasonable to expect not only a quality room but also a certain level of standard of service Perhaps this hotel should rename itself The Lebron James because it has about as much class as he does and is about twice as pretentious A handful of baby powder thrown into my face would have been a refreshing break from the level of service I received at The Lebron James My night of hell began with the clerk bellboy or whatever he was at the front desk who faked what I assume was intended to be a British accent but ended up as an unholy melding of Australian and New Englander A British accent does not make you fancy or skilled Once I made my way past Mr Belvedere and to my room I was disappointed not only by its size which was unusually small but also a faint scent of cigarettes Not a strong one but I could definitely smell smoke Not acceptable Then while I was sleeping a deep throbbing sound began to emanate from the walls It sounded technical mechanical like an air conditiner malfunctioning Despite many reassurances from the front desk the throbbing continued on throughout the night I demanded the man at the front desk come up and rectify the situation immediately but from what I could tell he never came,negative,false
Recently stayed at the James Chicago and will NOT be returning anytime soon The staff is unfriendly to say the least and the prices are outrageous Also not a fan of the fact they allow pets as guests There wasnt enough space in the gym and the lack of variety in equipment limits your options severely Ultimately i was very unimpressed with the services as a whole and would recommend you avoid this establishment,negative,false
We stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city Although the hotel looks nice the service is terrible The staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all The room service closes at 8pm so dont plan on getting hungry after that time Also even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries I will never go back to that place,negative,false
The staff at the James Chicago hotel seemed determined to make my stay a horrible one When I entered the establishment to check in I was ignored The clerk let half a dozen people in front of me before she even acknowledged me Thinking room service would be better I relaxed in my room while I waited for my food By the time it reached my room it was cold AND the wrong order Disgusted I went down to the pool only to find it was closed for maintenance All the restaurants the hotel recommended were onestar and none of my regular channels were on the tv All in all it was a bad stay at the James hotel in Chicago,negative,false
After staying at the James Chicago last weekend I can honestly say I will be going for affordability on my next trip The James Chicago is terribly overpriced and the staff was very cold and disconnected The chairs in the room looked like something out of Ikea I love Chicago but this hotel is definitely not one of its better places to stay I believe I would have been better off and happier staying at the Holiday Inn You dont always get what you pay for,negative,false
The James Hotel in Chicago was a huge let down I was expecting a truly spectacular experience On the website it appears to be an absolutely fabulous state of the art hotel Well my familys bad experience started right when we walked in the door It turns out the room we had reserved had been given to someone else and the man at the front desk was extremely rude We had to wait for an hour for the house keeping service to prepare a new room for us The room had an odd smell and we had to ask for towels and hand soap as they werent already in the room The one thing that was good about the place was the fabulous gym All in all I feel that we paid way too much for what we got Next time I will look to stay somewhere else,negative,false
The James Chicago is a stuffy uninviting hotel If you are looking for all of the comforts of home do not stay here The rooms are like boardroomsnot bedrooms Definitely not a childfriendly hotel The restaurant on site is also very modern and screams pretentious I would not vacation here again especially not with children They were afraid to touch anything in the whole hotel,negative,false
The Hotel Monaco claims to be a boutique Chicago luxury hotel but it certainly was neither luxurious nor stylish The pictures posted on the website imply that the guest is going to stay in a room with an amazing view but that was certainly not the case for this customer The decor which might be cutesy or charming to some was actually quite tacky and outdated The bathrooms had a musty smell and did not meet the cleanliness standards of a hotel claiming to be one of the top 40 hotels US Dont be fooled by a snappy website with some selective photosthis hotel does not live up to its billing You will be disappointed as was I if you expect anything more than a runofthemill experience at a merely average hotel,negative,false
The Hotel Monaco is a hotel that some say has character I found the decor tacky and had a hard time relaxing in the room designed with clashing colors and contemporary furniture I found the fact that you have to be a member of the Kimpton rewards club to get free wifi access to be annoying at the least Because of their petfriendly policy our room smelled like a wet dog and a canine guest down the hall kept us up all night with his howling Perhaps the dog would have howled less if the 24hour room service were faster We waited an hour and a half for our order meaning we did not get our dinner we wanted at 1000 pm until midnight All in all we would not stay here again The views and location are great but for the money there are better places to stay in Chicago,negative,false
I stayed here last August and Im truly glad that I will never have to stay here again The website does a great job of creating an illusion The rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website I thought the Monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt The wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow For such a classy hotel there isnt a pool At 46 per night the onsite parking is way too expensive for guests All and all I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,negative,false
If you are looking for a true luxury experience Hotel Monaco Chicago is not the place to go I stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience I did not get it Check in was not a pleasant experience The wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful The room was ok no roaches or anything but it was small and cramped And the mirrored headboard on my bed was more tacky motel than fancy hotel The house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 830a in the morning When I asked them to come back later they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back And getting extra towels was like pulling teeth I dont know if they thought I was going to steal them or what The room service food that I ordered was fine but it took forever to be delivered and was halfcold by the time I received it When I called the front desk to complain they apologized but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food They have a restaurant at the hotel but I did not bother to try it The prices were ridiculous the menu was limited and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel I was really disenchanted with this experience At 400 plus dollars a night I received mediocre accomedations and poor service Spend your hardearned money somewhere else,negative,false
I decided to spend the extra money booking a room at the Monaco because of the websites pictures of the beautiful rooms and views It was a waste of cash to say the least Although I had requested a room with a view of the city they must have given me the worst room in the place Maid service skipped over my room on my second day there and I had to call for towels at least twice before someone finally came to my room The food was outrageously expensive and not even lukewarm Twostar hotel quality,negative,false
I arrived to find that my room was not ready despite it being past the 3pm check in time I was not offered any compensation for this or any real apology just shunted off to the side to wait it out This took a good hour and a half during which time I was needing to be reading for a meeting Again no apologies just my card The room was adequately clean it had better be though sparsely furnished for the price It did not feel very welcoming and the decoration was reminiscent of bad nights spent in hot south coastal motels I encountered several problems with on site amenities both in room and out Some staff tried to be helpful on occasion but were rarely able to make headway even when I complained on the third night about rowdy neighbors It seemed as if where there was not apathy or cluelessness there was barely concealed surliness After the abysmal lack of service at the hotel bar I elected to eat out every other night I declined to try the room service unimpressed with every other offering so far I would not use this hotel for my business or personal trips,negative,false
I found my stay at the Hotel Monaco  Chicago to be less than satisfactory They lure you in with a fancy website promising the world and more but their services and amenities turned out to be a facade The pictures on the website show a grand fivestar lobby and one would assume the rooms match but when I received my room which by the way I could barely afford I found it to be no more luxurious than my local Motel 6 They mention that they are pet friendly Let me tell you that is code for smelly There was a faint urine smell throughout the entire hotel and I was awake all night because of the incessant barking Would not stay again,negative,false
Eww What a sickening affair the Hotel Monaco Chicago is a stuffy masterpiece of a hotel done wrong I stayed there recently and the rooms reek of the pretended elite classes whom fill its rooms I seriously was afraid to even lie between the sheets for fear of being charged a hefty linens fee I stayed in Chicago for a week I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for one night,negative,false
Me and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features We did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco We decided to stay for 3 nights When we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights The staff was upstiff and didnt not offer much hospitality Our room did have a view but of the city lights and kept our room bright even with the curtains closed The beds appeared soft but did not offer much comfort For what we paid we expected more,negative,false
When I first looked at the Hotel Monaco Chicago  a Kimpton Hotels website the hotel looked very pleasing and a great place for me to stay during my visit to Chicago The problems began when I called to make a reservation The woman who answered was very rude to say the least I had a few questions about the spa services She rushed through what sounded like she was reading through a brochure I decided that I shouldnt let one person ruin my experience with the hotel so I made a reservation and soon I was in Chicago The front desk service was very pleasant when I arrived and the room seemed clean other than the mysterious stain on my bedsheets I got dressed up and went down to the bar area for a drink and appetizers It took over thirty minutes for any worker to approach me for an order Yet two other parties that walked in after me were served right away I was baffled considering I was dressed nice and in a fairly good mood considering it was my first trip to Chicago Needless to say I will not be staying at this hotel again,negative,false
While visiting the Chicago area we chose the Hotel Monaco Chicago for our stay As one of the premier luxury hotels in Chicago we held high expectations but were quickly disappointed in what we recieved The problems began as soon as we arrived The attendant was not friendly nor did she have the smile that is suppose to be the symbol of Kimpton And when we went to our room only to discover that we had not been given what we had paid for the situation only got worse Rather than apologize for the error my credit card receipt was on hand we were blamed for the indescrpencies in rooms and told that not only was the room we had reserved and paid for more than two months unavailable we would not recieve a refund of the price difference of the two rooms I could not believe that a top 40 US hotel that is suppose to be committed to excellence could make such a blunder With no choice but to retreat back to our room we were pleasantly pleased with all of the amenities that we did recieve during our stay A beautiful hotel in the Chicago Loop but dont go expecting to be treated with respect or professionalism,negative,false
When we got checked and arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was the light didnt come on when we flipped the switch upon entering The room was not very clean at all Dust had collected on the back of the tv and on the stand behind it on the window sill and stains on the carpet We had requested wireless internet service but it was down the entire first night The mattress was very hard making for an uncomfortable night The jacuzzi was out of order also When asked to be moved to a different room we were informed that there were not others available,negative,false
My family stayed at the Hotel Monaco Hotel in Chicago from 25 September 2011 I have no complaints about the rooms but I do have to complain about the staff in general When we checked in the lady at the desk was rude to my children take it they were a little loud but it was daytime and she should have never spoke directly to my kids that way The cleaning crew the next morning didnt even knock at our door before opening the door My children were still sleeping and I was in the shower Thank god my husband was already at his conference The hotel was beautiful but the staff makes for a horrible experience Louisiana resident,negative,false
My Family and I went to this hotel on holiday last month It was a very bad hotel When we got there we imediatly checked in and went up to our room The view from the window was a brick wall Really? We even asked the Lasy at the front desk but she said they couldnt put us in a room with a view cause we didnt book one and we couldnt upgrade Also My Wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night Another thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true our room only had a normal tub But the tub had no stopper so we could only take showers The room was also very small compared to other hotels with around the same prices,negative,false
My wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and after our experience there we will not be returning With a hotel that markets itself as luxury we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck We were disappointed to say the least First of all we stayed in the King Deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small The space was used poorly  my wife and I could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space The decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality Although they said our room woudl be ready at 3 we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready Although the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology they didnt seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused The noise at night from the city is horrible  even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight The hotel would not move us to a different room All in all I felt that we paid 10000 for a luxury hotel and got a 40 Motel 6 We will definitely not be back anytime soon,negative,false
Having made regular business trips to Chicago I decided to stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago since it was fairly new and I had a friend that had stayed there The Lobby was quite small which surprised me with a name like Monaco As a matter of fact I found the furnishings to be quite drabA boy took my luggage and showed me to the suite It was two rooms not as spacious as I would have liked an entertainment room and a bedroom with a standard television Can You imagine I was expecting HD but it was just ordinary cable For 600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set The bath was ordinary nothing special but the bed was a very big KingThe view did not take in the Lake unfortunately just the Magic Mile Well I am starving so time to eat The restaurant was well appointed I hope the food was as good I ordered lamb chops potatoes au gratin and mint sauce It was fair I hope the rest of my trip si better than my accomadations I would give this hotel a two and a half but I would not return,negative,false
Traveled to this hotel on a family vacation We chose this hotel because it was pet friendly Upon arrival we smelled just how pet friendly it was The dog that greets you attacked my dog There was constant barking throughout the night and during breakfast I found hair in my eggs I would not recommend this hotel,negative,false
The hotel is located in an hard to fins location in Chicago the dining room for dinner is uncomfortably crowded the room service is hard to reach overall it was not a pleasant hotel stay,negative,false
We booked this trip several months in advance and were greatly looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago However our experience was significantly different from what we expected for the following reasons First of all there was only one person at the front desk when we arrived That person was preoccupied with something on their computer so our presence was not acknowledged for several minutes Then when we got to our room there were beautiful drapes in the window and across one entire wall but I found them to be incredibly dusty Just bumping into them slightly caused a cloud of dust to emerge which I found distasteful Overall it was a good stay but those two inconveniences made us question the amount of money we paid for it,negative,false
I stayed at the MonacoChicago back in April I was in town on business and the hotel was recommended by a friend of mine Having spent a weekend there I have no idea what my friend was talking about The complimentary morning coffee was weak the fitness room was dimly lit and I thought Id have to have my clothes mailed back to me when I used their supposed overnight laundry service for a suit I spilled some wine on My room was adequate but nowhere near what Ive seen elsewhere at this price point Recent renovation must be slang for everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive The mattress in my room was incredibly firm and I slept poorly When I travel I expect an experience similar to or better than my experience at home At most hotels I receive excellent service and comfortable accomodations This was an exception to my usual and I wont be back anytime soon,negative,false
I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago While higher priced the reviews online plus four stars convinced me Granted the hotel itself is beautiful but looks can be deceiving The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey The restaurant Cafe Des Architect had amazing food so that was a plus but the service was awful I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water My remote wouldnt work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud The hotel mustve been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently I called twice for more fresh towels If I wanted this type of experience Id have stayed at a lowerend hotel Same experience less money,negative,false
I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in Chicago for 3 nights I must say I was NOT impressed This is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill To start with the hotel lobby was totally gaudy It had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and I guess was supposed to give an air of style The room was ok I suppose but certainly not worth the premium price I paid for it The hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing French cuisine but the food while arranged nicely tasted unremarkable and again was overpriced My final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible It is simply not worth it,negative,false
I stayed at Sofitel with my husband for a weekend and I will NEVER be staying again The staff was rude the room was dirty and the decor is ugly and garish AVOID at all costs,negative,false
My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for three nights last month We were celebrating our anniversary so we decided to splurge on the Prestige Suite According to the website we were to be given either a city or park view neither of which we had Instead our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees The woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient and the man who helped with our bags was the same When we got to the room the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming The bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink My husband requested that we be given another room preferably a clean one but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available If given the chance I would not stay at this hotel again even if I were offered a free night,negative,false
Staying at the Sofitel was one of the less pleasurable experiences I have had in Chicago Upon entering there was no one offered to take my luggage so I was forced to carry it up to the check in desk The front desk staff was not friendly or welcoming The room was smaller than I expected and smelled of fake suede I decided to have drink and some food in Le Bar and upon entering I immediately noticed how dimly lit the room was I could barely see the bartenders face The drinks were alright and the food was subpar compared to what I was expecting After an hour I was ready for bed so I returned to my room to lay down The mattress was surprising stiff The noise was higher than expected as well Thankfully it was only a one night stay,negative,false
After arriving at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel I was greeted with rudeness and snubery My room reservations had been double booked and instead of the suite I expected I was given a much smaller guest room Instead of having a concierge I had cockroaches The dining left me wishing for fast food The bar left a bad taste in my mouth with the cheap liquor and hot beer,negative,false
The Hotel Sofitel Chicago Water Tower bills itself as a 4star luxury hotel but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder Filled with trite modern art and modular cheaplooking furniture that looks straight out of the latest Ikea catalogue this 32floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels I have ever seen Urban chic design does not equal comfort the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use Room service is expensive slow and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor The hotel features two bars the Cafe des Architectes Bar and the simply named Le Bar Cutesy French names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make Excellent service fair prices friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great none of which you will find at either of these bars Cafe des Architectes is also a restaurant offering seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with French roots which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality Even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak Pass this one by if youre looking for a comfortable enjoyable stay in downtown Chicago The Water Tower is dry,negative,false
The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower while seemingly a good idea in theory has many drawbacks At first glance it appears quite luxurious and grand but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked The hotel is quite tall coming in at 32 stories and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying The staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed The hotel tries to adopt a French flavor but its efforts fall short The only real French influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city but this location also adds to the lessthancozy feel of the establishment The same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general The citys traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy ones stay here Overall I would not recommend this hotel Make a different choice,negative,false
While traveling in Chicago I stayed at the Sofitel on Chestnut Street Though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest service was severely lacking I arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn I reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area I complained that I had not been informed of the construction and requested another room My complaint was totally disregarded I was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available When I explained that the noise was bothersome I was treated rudely The woman at the front desk actually ask me if I thought she could make the workers stop I understand that the staff has no control over the noise They did however know about the construction Information I did not have at the time I booked Information that would have swayed my decision Then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention I will not be staying there again,negative,false
The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in the downtown area is advertised as a fourstar luxury hotel However modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks Room service is available 24 hours a day but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service Two bars are located on the premises which is appealing at first Once inside patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy of any kind The guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine Obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult If you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hasslefree experience with reliable customer service booking a room here is probably not a viable option,negative,false
I stayed this hotel for 2 nights I had high hopes seeing as this is a 4 star hotel and seems quite elegant based on pictures Ive seen Upon entering the building you can easily see that it is clean and high class The lobby was nice and everything seemed as it should be However as soon as I made it into my room it was completely different than everything previous to it It was dirty visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom The room too was not completely organized as all other hotel rooms Ive been to There was also a lingering smell from the last tenants When I called the front desk about these issues they sent someone up to fix it I left the hotel about two hours and upon returning they were still at it This is an unreasonable amount of time to fix these glaring errors The smell also did not completely disappear when they were done As I was too tired I just decided to deal with it for the rest of my stay here and focus on enjoying my vacation at Chicago instead I hope its shallow exterior does not fool others like it fooled me,negative,false
When I made my reservations at Softiel in Chicago I was expecting the ultimate in Luxury but Softiel failed to deliver Everything was just ok I do not spend money on a quality hotel for just ok If I want just ok Ill check into the Days Inn First of all there were problems with our reservation I asked to have a room near the top floors and my room was actually only on the fifth floor The desk clerk was less than helpful to fix this I eventually got it fixed but I certainly did not feel at all like a valued guest during this process Later when I went down to ask for directions and information at the desk the clerk was very cold and abrupt with us The room was quite nice but the shower did not deliver adequate water pressure On the second day of our stay housekeeping did not refill our soaps or coffee They also failed to empty one of our wastebaskets Minor I know but when youre paying for a luxury experience you kind of expect luxury The hotel itself was nice but the staff really dont deliver I would not stay here again You can get a nice clean room at LaQuinta for 14 the price and the staff is much more helpful,negative,false
Our stay at the Sofitel was definitely below our expectations The staff was less than nice to me after I waited several minutes until I was noticed At first my reservation could not be found so I was provided a spare room The hotel was fairly neat However once we got to the room and onto the bed we found the bed to be noisy Just sitting on it made a squeaking noise that was unpleasant We immediately called down to the front desk and informed them of our concern We were told to go back downstairs to settle things out Once we got downstairs we were provided with another room number However we had to wait half an hour for another room to be cleaned and prepared For such a well reviewed hotel I was highly disappointed with the amount of time I had to spend to get settled into a room,negative,false
I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower My husband and I had planned a trip to Chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary We had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from California so they could have time with their grandchildren My husband and I had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to Iraq the week after we got married Everyone was so excited Mark and I had reservations for one of the junior suites We hadnt gone to Chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered Unfortunately when we got to our room the view was disappointing We had requested a nonsmoking room and were assigned to one but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there I am asthmatic and became very ill We asked to be moved to another room but were told there were no other rooms even downgrades available Nothing was done to try to make up for this Because of my health my husband and I checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend This is not how I had imagined spending such a special time Now when I think of my 10th anniversary I will always have this memory to tarnish it,negative,false
The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower was horrible The first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was OK to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they didnt even have a record of our reservation After much inappropriate arguing they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine When we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or TV It took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably The next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in A quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount We finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel the FancyPants Hotel and Suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club Overall the service at the Sofitel was rude rooms were unsatisfactory restaurant subpar not well kept up or clean In the future I would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record like the FancyPants Hotel and suits my personal favorite,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Sofitel Hotel Chicago Water Tower and I was quite disappointed I was excited by the great location on East Chestnut Street downtown but this was a mediocre hotel for the price 250 per night before taxes The view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters and yes the view of downtown in the distance was pretty but I was very disappointed The bedding seemed to be polyester not the luxury cotton many lowerlevel hotels are featuring lately When I ordered room service at 1030 on a Thursday night I had to wait for 55 minutes 20 minutes longer than I was quoted I ordered a salad and I thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long Overall I was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower,negative,false
Sofitel notsoluxury Hotels I recently checked out from a short stay at the chicago water tower I originally planned to stay for a week but as my business was concluded after only 3 days I decided I had had my share of the water tower Simply put it offered no reasons to stay The Hotel is quite lovely and elegantly dressed to impress but little more is put forth to sway the more acquainted crowed The First night was a spectacle meal and there was quite a crowd I think for the weekend The next night the food was only mediocre and the third when I orderd room service I had to call twice Even if you dont care about the food I think you would be wise to think twice about your stay if you have the choice They put on quite a show but that is all and when the show ended I was still hungry for more and there was no more to be found,negative,false
Upon first inspection Sofitel Chicago Water Tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown Chicago but appearances can certainly be deceiving Best summed up Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn It certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain even if it is an international one The customer service is poor unless you look like you have 50 to tip someone The furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea The rooms are dirty when you first walk in the air feels stale and the views are certainly all theyre cracked up to be None of this is worth a luxury price or even worthy of a luxury name I will certainly not be staying here again,negative,false
After booking a room over two months in advance at the Hotel Sofitel Chicago Watertower and confirming my reservation twice I arrived to find that the front desk staff had no record of my reservation and that the only rooms available were much more expensive than the room that I had reserved When I asked to speak to a manager it took almost half an hour for him to turn up He did finally give me a room at the rate that I had been promised but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience The room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay Not worth the rate though The website really makes this hotel seem upscale clean and well decorated but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby The staffs response to my request to move to another room because of the obvious dog smell which could only mean it hadnt been cleaned properly was met with contempt They did move me but I did not get an apology Will not stay again,negative,false
I was here on business so I needed to get some rest the next day but the walls were so thin that I could here all the carrying on in the neighbors room till 3 am This was very beautiful building the room was a lot smaller than I expected and the staff were not very friendly The person at the front desk had no personality did not even welcome me to the hotel All in all I dont think I will be back,negative,false
Affinia Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at Not in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest The front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation There was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself If it wasnt already a bad stay I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered If they didnt have air conditioning in the room I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable If you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business I hope you decide not to choose this hotel I was quite surprised I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Affina Chicago hotel and was really dissappointed When I arrived the desk clerk was really slow checking me in I feel like turtles could have checked me in faster I was finally checked in and my room was on the 8th floor The elevator ride seemed to take forever I arrived and the room and at first glance it looked great but after looking everything over there were finger smudges on the glass table I figured maybe room cleanin must have accidentally touched it I went to the CHouse for supper that evening and I had to wait for what seemed like forever The meal was good but my waitress was very uptight On my way back to my room I asked the front desk to set up a wake up call for 6 AM the next morning and they were very grateful to set that up It would have been nice to actually get it though The next morning I surprisingly work up at 718 AM and realized that I had not received a wake up call I was very upset and let them know Overall this experience was not worth the 4 stars that this hotel has been given For the price quality and ratings the Affina Chicago hotel has been given I would expect better service,negative,false
I stayed at the Affina Chicago for my anniversary The hotel is in a great location but that doesnt make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff It looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet I spent more money than I would normally hoping for a luxury experience and left very unsatisfied,negative,false
If you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option First of all the central location is not so convenient  there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier which this hotel claims to be the official hotel of and to the shops on the Mile Secondly the hotel is small  only 215 rooms most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area Thirdly they have one restaurant and one lounge both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel Finally the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel One does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia,negative,false
I just returned from a long weekend in Chicago with my wife We stayed at the Affinia hotel and I cant even begin to describe what an awful experience it was When we arrived at 4pm on Thursday checkin is 3pm our room was not ready We had to wait til almost 5pm before we could even get into the room Once inside the room smelled like an ash tray Obviously someone had deactivated the smoke detectors somehow and had been smoking in the room We decided to just go out for an early dinner After arriving back to our room around 9pm our key didnt work We had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get a new one The next morning the maids started knocking on our door at 730 in the morning Why would you try to clean the room that early?? The do not disturb sign was on our door for the rest of the stay After that early wakeup we went downstairs to request a different room due to the terrible smell in the one we were assigned The front desk employee gave me a very condescending look and sighed when I asked Eventually we did get a new room but I didnt enjoy the demeanor I encountered to do so Our new room was fairly nice and the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful but I have a bad taste in my mouth and likely wont stay there again,negative,false
My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week in a studio suite which was NOT worth the extra payment It was an absolute NIGHTMARE To begin with the room is listed as oversized when its nothing of the sort Weve previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller I believe the only extra space was in the closet which isnt very useful unless you plan on living there We had our two sons with us so we had to make extra sleeping space Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time complaining of bugs moving around He must have been umcomfortable also as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock The room service is horrible they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm and she had to wait up for that My family would NEVER go back to this hotel and I highly recommend you also stay well away,negative,false
Terrible experience I will not stay here again The walls were so thin that I was kept up all night by the party going on in the suite next to mine I talked to the management several times but nothing was done It may just be the people that I had contact with but I thought the staff was standoffish and rude Very unpleasant experience especially given the cost of staying here,negative,false
I stayed at the Affnia hotel in Chicago and was extremely unsatisfied I would recommend everyone to avoid this hotel I paid 700 overall for 2 nights in a cheap small untidy room Granted Ive stayed at hotels of similar quality but never have I paid so much for one of them I could not believe what I saw when I walked into the roomit was tiny and there was small patches of mold on the wall that had been painted over The breakfast I ordered wasnt terrible but certainly wasnt good The wifi connection was horrendously slow If you want to spend a big buck on a hotel finejust dont spend it here,negative,false
After reading good reviews about the Affinia Hotel in Chicago my husband and I decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary Unfortunately the hotel missed the mark for us I did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4star hotel Because my husband and I have had a bad experience with bedbugs as a rule we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff they practically accused us of planting the bugs there I was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled Needless to say we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary I have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation I have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that I will be refuting the charge for the one night the Affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline,negative,false
I was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at Affinia Chicago When I arrived to check in my reservation that I had made and confirmed 2 weeks earlier was not in the computerI had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me The whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted nonstop on her cell phone while the office phone rang off the hook I had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in roomIll never go backdont waste your money,negative,false
What a terrible experience my family and I had at Affinia Chicago First of all we reserved a room with 2 queen size beds and received only 1 King size bed with a cot When we got to the room we found hair balls on the floor as if a cat had previously stayed there What an absolute terror Affinia was and I will never be going back,negative,false
The Affinia in Chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences If you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for Affinia do not expect any measure of customer service and dont expect great accommodations even at their high prices When we arrived our reservation was lost then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available The furnishings in the room were cheaply made the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotels L shaped corridor I called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time Two hours later someone came The dining hall and reception areas were really nice but again unless youre a large group dont expect to enjoy them during your stay at Affinia Even if you could the prices wouldnt be worth it,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago and it was one of the worst experiences Ive ever had at a highend hotel I was in Chicago for a conference and I thought I would enjoy the experience more if I had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to but this hotel definitely wasnt that place The restaurants were mediocre at best despite their high prices I repeatedly got food that was bland overcooked or lukewarm The room was fine but nothing special I think Id have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown Chicago A big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel though was with their Jet Set Pets program its hard to find a decent relaxing hotel that Ill like that will also accept my dog But many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt who is energetic and loves people but isnt the most photogenic dog  he has a scar on his face and hes got that terrier look Multiple people mocked him or said there was no point grooming him or asked why I wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room I know that its a fairly highend hotel but I would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs I hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well The experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory especially for the price I can give them good marks on their spa services and I really appreciated the pillow menu but other than that it didnt feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience especially given the customer service,negative,false
Extremely disappointed in our stay This hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online I booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for The room smelled musty and not clean Garbage was not changed from prior person Found small ants in bathroom near shower Called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray Overall this hotel is in a great location but we would never visit again Staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online,negative,false
Affinia hotel in Chicago was one of the most interesting hotels I have ever stayed in Everything looks very nice and fancy though the people that work there must be from the projects of Chicago The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life When we went to check in first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in When the women at the counter finally acknowledged us she was smacking her gum and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her The room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude I would NEVER go back and I hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business,negative,false
There are many highquality hotels in Chicago There are many highquality hotels on the magnificent mile and then there is the Affinia Chicago With its neoclassical stylings and its nonclassical service it is just a combination for trouble We had established our reservations for Friday the 15th amd arrived at 4pm to checkin No Room One hour after their posted check in time and nothing No apology no offer for upgrade no discount Nothing As a seasoned traveler I have had my share of disappointments but this tops the list,negative,false
Our trip to Chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the Affinia Hotel Because their rates were actually higher than we were used to in New York City we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment We could not have been more wrong This place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition Uunfortunately it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way Both the Dream Pillow Menu and the Experience Kit were a complete flop With the Dream Pillow Menu the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from downstuffed to hypoallergenic selections We happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out At first I thought it was my imagination so I stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed More dust came out them Particles were flying around the room Im now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand I called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows These pillows were some kind of music pillow that pluged into an mp3 player I was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night In general the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows Another failed gimmick they offered was the Experience Kits We were given ours to keep a collection of some maps which were actually very nice a walking tour guide that was all marked up and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards If this place lacked attention to detail that is one thing but it lacked any attention at all If the pillows werent already enough at this point I was certain that I would never stay at this establishment again Run dont walk away from this place,negative,false
I truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment but my time spent at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago forced me to do so It was to be our first trip to Chicago since I was a boy so my wife and I were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel First I must say that the counter help was far less than helpful The apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service He said we had not reserved a room which I had weeks earlier and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that WE must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both Finally the manager arrived after I insisted on his presents He did straiten out the confusion but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants I called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place We were shown to another room this time to our liking From that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the Affinia had To list just a few the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels the food that room service brought up was cold lifeless and bland the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and I lift the room To be blunt I truly hope that the CEO of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff guts the building thoroughly and is publicly flogged in a downtown park WE WILL NEVER STEP THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE AFFINIA AGAIN,negative,false
Hello I recently stayed at the Affinia hotel in Chicago and was very unhappy when I learned of additional charges upon arrival When I made the reservations over the phone there was no mention of any internet or parking fees When I arrive Im told fee to valet park is 49 per day plus another 10 for internet This is just plain ridiculous and will remember not to stay here in future Theres too many other fine hotels that dont charge these fees,negative,false
What I hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare The first sign of trouble at the Affinia was that they couldnt find my reservation Add to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked The internet service was so slow it was unusable To top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible Finally I discovered the valet parking which was a 49 premium service dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car I highly recommend going elsewhere when you visit Chicago,negative,false
The Ambassador East Hotel is a terrible place to stay All of the rooms are old and dirty as though they havent been cleaned or remodeled for years The hotel staff is not friendly or accomodating Do not waste your money in this crappy old hotel full of rude employees,negative,false
The Ambassador East is a particularly crappy property given the numerous quality hotels in and around the Gold Coast Unfortunately I saw an amazing rate and decided to book  this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for While the lobby was gorgeous and appears to match the photos on the website the room I was assigned was run down and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website It looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty The room also smelled of must or mildew While the room did have airconditioning as advertised it was an inwindow unit that sounded like it was on its last leg I was only here for a single night but had I been here for anywhere longer I would have requested a refund Please if youre staying in this part of town do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here The Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn are both nearby clean and often have specialoffers  these arent the only properties in the area but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay,negative,false
During my recent trip to Chicago I stayed at the Ambassador East hotel which is located in the downtown are I have to say I was not pleased with my stay there For one I had requested that my room have one king sized bed when I called for reservations however when I arrived the hotel lobby clerk said they did not have any king sized beds left and I had to settle with two double sized beds When I told the clerk that a king sized was promised when i made the reservation he just shrugged his shoulders When I got to my room I found it to be very small There was supposed to be a small refrigerator in the room There wasnt although I did not bother to complain after all it did when they gave me the wrong bed At night there seemed to be some sort of convention being held at the hotel I did not figure what the convention was for but their attendees liked to stay up until the early morning and made way too much noise I called the front desk several times complaining about the noise Each time they assured me they would deal with the noise but the racket never dissipated and I finally gave up getting any sleep I did go back to the lobby before my trip ended to complain of the poor service that they have given me the manager said that she felt sorry for the trouble I had been having at the hotel but did not offer any refund or consolation for the trouble When I left the Ambassador East I vowed that if I ever returned to Chigaco I would never stay at this place again,negative,false
My husband and I recently went to Chicago for my Aunts funeral We are not familiar with the area so we asked for recommedations of where to stay for the two nights we would be in town We were told to stay at the Ambassador East Hotel I wish we could say that our experience there was a good one but sadly it was one of of the more disappointing travel experiences we have had Upon check in we were quickly shown to our rooms but when we entered our king suite a very strong musty smell greeted us on the other side At first I thought I was just being sensitive but after about an hour in the room we simply had to request to be moved The smell was too overwhelming The front desk said they would be happy to move us but the only other room available was a suite with two double beds rather than the king bed suite we originally reserved While this was not exactly what we wanted we didnt really have a choice to refuse After transfering to the new room and getting settled we discovered that the electrical outlet near the sink in the bathroom did not work While this did not bother my husband too much I was very annoyed as I need the mirror while I use my hair dryer curling iron etc I absolutely did not want to have to switch rooms yet again so I simply had to make due with doing my hair next to the bed They also only gave us two towels of any kind in the bathroom so we had to request washcloths and small hand towels BOTH DAYS we were there Each time the housekeeping staff seemed incredibly annoyed at these requests For what we paid to stay at this hotel we were not impressed at all The customer service was lackluster and the rooms were not up to par If you are ever in Chicago do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else,negative,false
I had heard good things about the Ambassador East and decided to stay there on vacation with my husband  what a mistake First off they charge for being able to use the internet which should be a given these days especially for how much you pay for the room The champagne was cheap  I could have spent 15 to get my own bottle The King room was just as small as a double room anyway The bed was really hard and crudely made Maybe there was someone new on the staff that didnt know how to make a bed but besides that the sheets were starched to military stiffness It was so uncomfortable When I asked if we might get some new sheets the staff were so incredibly rude and told me I was basically stuck with what I had because theyre all that way I was appalled Anyway we gave it a shot and stayed there that night in the mediocre luster of the room design We didnt sleep well and didnt particularly enjoy ourselves especially because apparently there was a wedding going on in the building because we could hear the party I mean talk about the opposite of peaceful Again we tried appealing to the staff to have our room moved away from the party but they said they couldnt move us because of the romance package What a jip After the kind of fun wed had we realized we couldnt handle anymore We called for a manager the next morning and fought with him for a couple hours We wanted to just cancel the second night of our stay and he said hed do that but that wed still be charged a percentage of it After telling him everything that had happened and how displeased we were we finally got him to not charge us and left to go stay at another hotel that was actually relaxing,negative,false
I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel this past summer for 5 days and it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had Firstly the sheets that were on the bed seemed as if they were the same ones the previous guests had left on there they looked dingy or just plain dirty Second I went to function one night and came back in late so I was really tired the next morning hence I slept in late I put the Do Not Disturb sign on my door and the room service still came knocking down my door asking if they can come and clean Obviously the room service lady cant read Third and worst of them all when I checked I was only allowed valet parking so I gave up my keys hoping to get back my car in one piece Well the next morning when I asked for my car to be retrieved there was a big dent in the drivers door of my 2010 Mustang I was livid and the valet guy was insisting that he got it like that In the end I had to get my door repaired on my own The only thing I liked there was the food and it wasnt even all that I was so disappointed and so Im warning everyone to think twice before you make a reservation,negative,false
I booked a room at this hotel expecting great accommodations considering the price but was disappointed The room looked nice but I found that there werent any extra blankets in the closet and the heating system was dysfunctional I came back to the room after a meeting and found that it still had not been cleaned even though it was the late afternoon I asked for replacement towels and they were very late in coming I would have expected there to be a shuttle of some sort to the airport especially since the website advertises the close distance Instead I had to call for a taxi and was almost late for my plane because the taxi was stuck in traffic All in all not the best experience at all,negative,false
I had high hopes for the Ambassador East Hotel I really did It seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access I arrived to the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon I was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in I could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck doing nothing As I walked in nobody greeted me and nobody offered to take my bags The hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated with a fine covering of dust I went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer I got to my room and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway Having paid extra for an upgraded room I was extremely disappointed by the condition inside The drinking glasses were filthy the towels smelled of mold and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can The television was a basic CRT that looked to be about fifteen years old and there was no channel guide though I suppose I didnt need one for the six channels that it had I had heard good things about the food at the Ambassador East hotel but alas there was no respite here The room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done Elsewhere in the hotel things were no better Everywhere I went from the pool to the bar the staff was hasty rude and completely uninterested and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated I really wanted to like the Ambassador East Hotel but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for two night and my visit was nothing short of disappointing Expecting to have a wonderfully romantic weekend with my fiance we specifically chose this hotel because we prefer boutique hotels for the extra attention from the staff and unique atmosphere Our expectations for the Ambassador were not met The room was small and frankly outdated The bathroom smelled musty The AC in the room had two settings polar cold or off The walls did nothing to muffle sound from adjacent rooms and it was loud at night  a good nights sleep was impossible Staff were indifferent Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel Frankly its not worth the steep price and mediocre character Since there are far better and more accommodating boutique hotels in Chicago I know I wont be back at this place,negative,false
This hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat The first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket This place looks alright in the lobby but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in Chicago this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night Clearly the Ambassador East Hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession Not to mention that it is at least 3040 minutes from the airport in traffic Chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call,negative,false
My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel last month for my sons wedding When we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to Valet our car After waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip which I found rude After finally getting to our room I noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom I was extremely disappointed with the room and the service I will not recommend this place to anyone,negative,false
My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Ambassador East Hotel We will never stay at this hotel again For the steep price we paid to stay there we expected a friendly staff and clean room which we did not get First of all the rooms are not clean We found a few bugs in our room and the sheets did not look like they have been recently changed When we reported this information to the hotel staff they did not do anything to help us out The staff is very unfriendly Also there were no clean towels to use in the bathroom,negative,false
My wife and I stayed at the Abassador East Hotel in August to attend the Air and Water Show in Chicago I called ahead to ensure a SW view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches Upon arrival at the hotel not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it wasnt even a single king as was requested Apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room The room itself was small and underwhelming The was not dirty but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel The hotel was packed the weekend we visited The staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd The concierge and reception desks were continuously busy The hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits The main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult Luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable We will not be staying at the Abassador on future trips Hopefully current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe,negative,false
when we arrived the check in process was fairly quick however the staff seemed in a bad mood all around they seemed as if we were taking up their time when we got to the room we tried to use our personal computer to look for attractions and after having to pay 10 a day for wifi it was a total waste of money the speed of the internet was extremely slow the free workout area was also not up to our expectations but since it was free we didnt complain overall we would never stay at this hotel again and we do not recommend it,negative,false
The Ambassador Hotel is located in Downtown Chicago right off Lakeshore Drive in the heart of the hotel industry downtown I would recommend you look to one of those other hotels if you are wanting a place to stay downtown The rates at this hotel indicate that it would be a top of the line place to stay when in fact we had a pretty unpleasant experience It started with someone who was obviously a new employee checking us in I have no problem with this except the fact that this person was the only one on duty and had difficulties checking us in and had no one to assist him After checking in we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed The pictures do not accurately depict the size of these rooms they are very tiny and offer very little room to store luggage where it is out of the way The beds were not very comfortable and when we called room service for extra pillows they took over an hour to arrive I will not be staying at this hotel anytime in the future,negative,false
The Ambassador East Hotel is a pretty girl with a bad heart As i was staying for a few nights I notied may problems with the service of this expensivecold hotelFirst the room sevice was poorly helpful the bag boy insisted on a tip and also droped my bag The chefs cooking was terriablethe steak that I spent 35 dollars on was suppost to be rare but came to me burnt The room was not what you pay for the beds were like a sack of rocks And to top it off the covers smelled like smoke I will never give the Ambassador East Hotel another chance,negative,false
I will never use Ambassador East Hotel again The first appearance you get is a very dark and dreary type setting The exterior of the hotel was in desperate need of repair The customer service was not as good as you would expect when spending your hard earned money on a hotel room In this hotel you are spending more than the average amount of money on a room that is smaller than the average hotel room I felt rushed out at check out and didnt have an enjoyable experience at all,negative,false
Stayed at this hotel for labor day weekend and it was pretty awful The staff were relatively friendly but thats where the positive aspects stop Bed was rock hard and VERY uncomfortable Thermostat didnt work properly and the air conditioner was always 5 degrees warmer or colder than what you wanted Even though I think 10 for 1 day of internet is RIDICULOUS I bought it because I needed to download a powerpoint for work and send off a few emails It was UNGODLY slow and barely better than dialup I ended up finding a starbucks to use their wifi so I could actually get something done Minibar was overpriced as expected Awful experience definitely wouldnt stay here again,negative,false
My experience at the Ambassador East Hotel was truly terrible I went to Chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding This hotel was recommended by the wedding party It was a terrible choice Despite the special discount we got because of the wedding the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels The staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children My kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason The place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items My son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart Overall I would say I was very displeased with the staff the hotels attitude towards children and the expense of the hotel On the plus side our window had an excellent view of the city Still I would not return here again,negative,false
We originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website read about their romantic weekend getaway Having never been in the area before or stayed at an Ambassador Hotel we really didnt know what to expect but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be Upon arriving the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic It only went downhill from there The bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we couldnt figure out what it was We ended up getting a different room which was very mediocre Needless to say we wont be staying here again,negative,false
The Hard Rock should stick to restaurants After a recent stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago I think they should go back to what there good at Besides having to wait an hour for my room to be ready this is after my check in time the receptionist was very rude and seemed to not care that I was being delayed After seeing the state the room was in I still do not understand what took so long The sheets look to have been picked up off the floor and returned to the bed The bathroom looked as if somebody had just used it I will leave out the details Complaining didnt seem to get me anywhere they offered me a small discount at the hotels bar After this experience I will be more likely to book at a Motel 6 then return to the Hard Rock,negative,false
The name Hard Rock might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here The website alludes to musicians and parties but if youre looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the Hard Rock falls short The hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this The service is mediocre and the rooms arent clean I stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in Chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun exciting romance I should have picked somewhere else Save your money,negative,false
Hi I had very bad experience with this hotel as the rooms had bad smell and very dim light the bed sheets were not properly cleaned Also the carpet was dirty though AC was working properly But i would nor recommend this hotel to my friends as it did not satisfied me There was a problem with hot and cold water in the bathroom Please do not go to this hotel it seems very nice from the pictures and all but in actual its different,negative,false
This was my first time staying at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago and I have nothing but hate for the entire experience The building itself is maintained however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill And while the outside appearance is fine and dandy my room 325 was repulsive As soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the rooms ground and verbally demanded a tip I noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement before I could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled Immediately I went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour a complete waste of time because as soon as I had reported my problem I was told that no other rooms were available and I would have to make do they did however say I could stay the night free of charge The next morning as I was set to leave I decided I would try the breakfast in hopes of finding one redeeming quality Let me tell you that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold the worst breakfast I have ever had in my entire life Overall the employees are arrogant and callous with the work ethic of a 2 year old child they cannot cook the room for me was poorly maintained however they are good at refunding your money,negative,false
I stayed at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago last year and can say i was not satisfied with my experience I feel that it didnt live up to what was advertised and the accommodations were subpar at best I had the chance to catch a show and the music was too loud and the sound guys work resembled that of an amateur My personal rating is 25 stars and i would not recommend this hotel to a friend,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago Il From the start the experience was bad The room was filthy there were no towels and the front desk did nothing to rectify the situation I will never stay there again I could not have been more dissatisfied,negative,false
For 250 dollars cheapest room available at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago you would assume you would have access to wifi Yet that was not the case I was told I could have had internet if I had booked through the site which I didnt The lady in the reception had no idea what she was talking about and had to ask around about internet access in general,negative,false
What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit inthey knew we had 6 We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor unfortunately one of the rooms hadnt even been cleaned which meant more waiting around The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 530am Despite my calls to the front desk the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes We also didnt know the hotel was sooo pet friendly One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door I understand they allow pets but reallypeople need to clean up after their animalsor have some dog free floors While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms their service was terrible the staff was rude and I still cant get over that dog poo in the hallway I definitely wont be staying here again,negative,false
The hard rock hotel Chicago is not as good as they try to portray First ill start off by saying there website is confusing and hard to navigate through They also have rude customer service that dont seem happy to answer your questions There prices are so outrageously expensive for what they offer its just ridiculous Hard rock hotel has a good rep behind there name but Hard rock hotel Chicago should not be included in that,negative,false
My husband and I stayed here at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago a few months back I wasnt particularly impressed with their customer service When we arrived to check in the front desk clerk was quite rude and unfriendly She was short with me when I asked her about the citys attractions and things to do Our room wasnt all that great either It was rather small and had a weird smell to it I wont be staying here again,negative,false
I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently for a convention I was attending This was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations Checkin took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations Once I did get into my room there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a nonsmoking room I went down to the front desk and requested a room change Given their computer problems that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and didnt have the positive attitude in spite of any difficulty Id expect from such a high profile establishment The new room was not a suite as I had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling When I hooked up my laptop I was dismayed to discover that there was no wifi service I had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wifi for online ressies but as part of their computer problems the wifi service was down Fortunately there was a Starbucks up the street with available wifi Granted I couldnt lounge at the Starbucks in my jammies like I could in my hotel room but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices I was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as its not something that is necessarily under the control of local management However the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management A quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while I was down the street at Starbucks They did as promised and when I arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customers DNA and the dust bunny population had been eradicated Once I had a chance to relax in the room there were a few minor details that stood out The carpet was starting to get worn in places the edges on some of the furniture was dinged and my personal pet peeve the inside of the drawers were rough unfinished wood which I dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes I would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel But all things considered my stay was tolerable Water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep The wifi was still down in the morning so I checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wifi at Starbucks,negative,false
Hard Rock Hotel boats that they have the best of the high scale accommodations for your business or pleasure stays What they fail to disclose is just how expensive your stay will be The service tends to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the patrons service is more redily available and friendly the more you makeThe rooms are furnished with attractive but old furnishings The laundry service leaves more to be desired The sheets have a gray tint to them and the rooms smell of tobacco I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and was disappointed with not only the service but the cleanliness of the room from the bathroom to the beddingYour stay at any hotel should be memorable and restfulafter all isnt that what we pay for?,negative,false
I have visited Chicago with my family several times and have never had such a HORRIBLE hotel experience The staff was rude and unhelpful and they overcharged my card by more than 300 I had to spend the whole morning on the phone trying to get them to finally fix their mistake The hotel itself didnt live up to our expectations eitherthe inside was dingy and needed cleaning and our room looked like a bunch of chain smokers had just thrown a crazy party in the room There were cigarette burns on the sheets stains on the floor and there was a hole in the wall where it looked like someone had punched it We requested another room which was only marginally better in terms of cleanliness only to be kept up all night from the noise of our neighbors yelling and hanging out in the hallway There are plenty of other places to stay in Chicago AVOID Hard Rock at all costs,negative,false
I would not reccomend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for two nights this past July I had a select king city view room The room was dark with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door  not a great view I was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow The hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there When I called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did I ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door They quieted down for about an hour but then were loud again for the rest of the night The hotel was expensive and for the price there werent very many special amenities There was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included  you had to sign up for a day of service at 10 a day Overall I would not recommend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago as it is way overpriced for what you get,negative,false
I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online However my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations When I arrived well over an hour of check in time I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue As I am a fairly light sleeper I woke up several times throughout the night I would recommend bringing earplugs if youre also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep Overall the hotel looked very nice but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room,negative,false
While the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago promises upscale accommodations and a unique experience they fail to deliver Unless of course a unique experience includes being kept awake all night by a party in the room next door If you plan on staying there for a chance to meet your favorite celebrity or musician you will be sorely disappointed The A list celebrities will not be there In fact it would be rare to find anyone on the B list either The party that keeps you awake will not be your favorite band practicing for their next concert The party is being held by the musicians that were not even able to gain work at a local coffee bar The walls of the rooms are so thin you can hear every wrong note played As for the promise of Art Deco it must have changed in definition Your room will truly look like a concert has just been held The carpet smelled like it had been shampooed in beer The bathroom lets just say that clean was not the correct description Quality service and amenities were severely lacking Guests are not greeted with warmth but with disdain Do not bother complaining about the noise next door either It is part of you unique experience The only part of the Hard Rock Hotel description that appeared to be accurate was that it is in a great location in Chicago It was easy to find a real hotel to stay in for the rest your trip,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago during Labor day weekend huge mistake When I got to my room everything seemed okayUntil I went into the bathroom There was a steady drip noise coming from the bathroom sink and no matter how hard I turned the knob it would not stop There was none of the usual bath soap nor was it stocked with any toilet paper It also seems that housekeeping just swept everything behind the toilet as I saw a wad of hair and scraps of tissue behind the bowl I called the front desk and ask them to send someone up to stock the bathroom and clean it While I was waiting I turned on the air conditioning because it was kind of warm in there the ac started blowing out hot musky air and had the room smelling horrible I made another phone call to front desk and complained and asked them to switch my room They told me all they had available was a double bed and it was near an elevator I was so frustrated between the odor and the steady drip I was hearing I had no choice but to take it When I moved to the new room there was now a large damp spot near the window which smelled very strongly of beer and the light in my bathroom would not turn on Front desk once again sent someone to my room to fix the problems and finally 2 hours later I was able to relax and settle in Hard Rock is definitely not what it used to be and for that reason I will not be staying there again,negative,false
I was really excited when we booked a night at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago It was actually beyond our budget but my husband and I needed a weekend away so I decided to splurge for the occasion WORST WASTE OF MY MONEY EVER Our room was smaller than pictured online and it looked like the maid didnt vacuum the carpet We visited the hotel restaurant Angels and Kings one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husbands steak was cooked wrong he ordered medium but received a welldone steak By the end of our trip we were so glad to leave but they were understaffed and the Sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out Chicago was a fun city but next time we return Ill be choosing a different hotel  and I suggest you do too,negative,false
A few weeks ago we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago The hotel was a bust from the get go As we arrived in the lobby we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up We could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes When she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful We had to wander around the halls looking for our room Once we got to our room we thought the weekend was going to get better The rooms are modern and nicely designed That was about all that this hotel had going for it though As soon as we started to explore the room more it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before The bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it We called a worker and they cleaned most of it up but the thought of it still remained As we all settled down to sleep there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door After about an hour we finally made a call to the front desk to complain The woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in Chicago They were staying there the next 2 nights I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone Its a hard rock hotel all right At least thats what the beds feel like,negative,false
Hotel is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud it is hard to sleep during the night because all the citynoises coming from the outside The rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures I stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband and we supposed to get room with king size bad but instead we got two single beds The stuff isnt really very nice either they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you,negative,false
My recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago was miserable My visit began on the wrong foot when they couldnt locate my reservation I had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldnt find me in the system We finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over That process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations The room that I had originally reserved King was not available and I had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a Double room I was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that I decided to stay in and order room service It took an hour and a half for my food to arrive When finally delivered it was cold and not exactly how I had ordered it So now I am cranky tired and starving I ate what I could from the mini bar poor selection of items and went to bed The room was spacious but had a stale smell to it as if someone had smoked in it The next morning I complained and wanted to change rooms The woman at the front desk couldnt be bothered with me and didnt try to make things right in any way I decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Chicago I will never waste my time or money at The Talbott again,negative,false
The Talbott is definitely not worth the price you pay I was really looking forward to staying here since it was recently renovated  was in a good location Unfortunately it just didnt live up to the hype Recently renovated apparently means it was redone in the last decade not the last year It was just very tiredlooking Also very disappointing was the food and the service was hit or miss I expected better from a hotel of this caliber Bottom line there are better places with better value Stay elsewhere,negative,false
We chose the Talbott Hotel primarily for the location but quickly discovered that the location was the only good thing about it Although their website did a good job of selling their services and amenities we found both severely lacking We had mentioned to the reservationist when booking that this was to be a romantic weekend getaway for us  it was our anniversary We asked for and were promised a king room However when we checked in we were told by the front desk clerk that no king rooms were available We could either take a double queen room or pay significantly more for a suite We took the key for our double queen room and were on our way Upon arriving on our floor we found a rowdy group of young girls running up and down the hallway squealing and playing It turns out that this hotel offers American Girl visits for the nearby store It turns out that our romantic getaway room was in the center of a block of rooms reserved for a Girl Scout troop on an American Girl trip We went back downstairs to request a move to another room and were told no other double queen rooms were currently available We explained that we were here for our anniversary and the ambiance wasnt exactly what we were looking for The clerk rolled her eyes and told us that she couldnt help us  they didnt have anything else Sorry Back upstairs we went Tired from travel we decided to order from room service for dinner Our pasta when it arrived was barely warm and mediocre in flavor We ate it anyway and prepared for bed After using the bathroom we discovered that the toilet in our room continued to cycle water after flushing After jiggling the handle a few times and poking around in the tank we couldnt get the water to stop running It took three hours for a maintenance staff member to make their way up to our room to fix the problem The next morning after showering I discovered the hair dryer didnt work properly After pulling my wet hair back in a clip we went out for the day Upon our return we expected to find our room made up and fresh It hadnt been touched We called downstairs to have someone sent up to clean it but by the time wed left for dinner nobody had arrived Our room wasnt made up that day That night the Girl Scouts sat in the hallway giggling and singing until well after 1am We asked them several times to be quiet but they didnt want to listen and their chaperones were nowhere to be seen We called down to the desk and they told us they would take care of it but the girls continued to have their party in the hallway anyway Nobody came to shoo them away The next morning I turned on the hairdryer expecting it to work after reporting the difficulty the day before It didnt Stuck wearing my clip again we checked out and made a mental note to select another hotel in the area for our next trip This hotel had potential but the staff doesnt care enough about your experience to allow me to recommend it to other travelers,negative,false
I recently stayed in a room at the trendy Talbott Hotel It looked nice on the outside so I decided to them a whirl As soon as I walked in I noticed that there werent alot of hotel employees Usually the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand I was tired and I needed a nice room so as I approached the front desk I noticed something odd Food was sitting out right in front of the front desk People were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush Crumbs everywhere especially where I was suppose to exchange cash and room keys Lets just say it wasnt professional The room was average and the bathroom didnt carry the kinds of brands I would have liked to see No WiFi connection and I had to walk down the hall for ice Talk about lack of customer service All in all the stay was subpar and nothing special,negative,false
The staff at the Talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when I told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding dong ditch The sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my twoweek stay The room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap but I did notice the contents of the minibar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room,negative,false
The Talbott Hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome If you do not pay higher prices you are snubbed and the rooms are no classier or fancier than a standard motel The room service takes over an hour and there is constant traffic and construction outside The cost is far more than the luxury The best thing about staying at this hotel are the bathroom towels,negative,false
For a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor think Motel 6 at a Hilton price Carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin They are so worried about the minibar they constantly do these random room checks so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of For the prices they charge 350average price for two people It seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby which was happening while I stayed could have been better spent on better insulation and more uptodate furnishings for the guest rooms But I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests which I wont be,negative,false
My daughters broken heart My daughter loves American Girl and for her birthday wanted to go to American Girl Doll in Chicago For six months my eight year old counted day the day until we left for Chicago when she could have the experience of a lifetime We arrived at the Talbot Hotel where we had reserved the American Doll Girl package only to find out that they had given our room away and that they were going to move us across town If that wasnt bad enough we had to spend an hour to find out if the American Girl carriage ride had been canceled or if we should book another one My daughter sulked for most of the trip as we spent more time going from thing to thing instead of being able to walk My daughter cried herself to sleep the first night and I could tell that her heart was broken,negative,false
I booked my reservations at The Talbott Hotel in hopes of finding luxury and excellent service What I actually got was far less than that When I first arrived to check in the woman at the desk was very impolite and looked rather bored It took her over 5 minutes to even find my reservation in the computer system And I wont go into detail about how she messed up with my room keys and had to give me a second set When I finally got to my room the first thing I noticed was that it smelled stale The air in the room literally smelled like it had been in that room without any fresh air for years I soon discovered my bathroom toilet had a leak as well and every time you flushed the toilet water would trickle out from the base onto the floor Talk about concerning I reported this to the desk and the fellow who answered promised someone would be up right away to fix it No one showed up until the next day and very early in the morning I might add Later I called room service and asked for a bottle of wine It took them half an hour to deliver it to my room And it wasnt even chilled by the time it showed up either it was lukewarm Overall my experience here was not very pleasant and I dont recommend booking with this hotel,negative,false
For all the hype and rave reviews of the Talbott Hotel it seemed to me that it would be a mistake to NOT stay there not the other way around The Talbott Hotel website claims to have opulent accommodations impeccable service and unexpected delights The last time I checked opulent had a bit of a different meaning than easily outdone by the senile 90yearold landlord of your college apartment impeccable wasnt code for rude and unfriendly and unexpected delights were more fun than a faint but obvious stain on your sheets at a hotel Overall my stay here simply wasnt worth the money or the hassle involved in making the correct reservations For a lot lessI could have been treated rudely and had a mediocre stay in a more casual environment,negative,false
WARNING My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott They were promoting up to 30 breakfast credit per day And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee which we wouldnt have known had he not told us that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6 not a luxury hotel in Chicago The linens were stained room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee I was truly disgusted After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten The toast was stale eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs and the juice they served was sour I would never recommend this as a place to stay I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime,negative,false
I had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago I thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicagos exciting night life I found The Talbott Hotels website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for The price sounded reasonable so I booked a room The two of us were so very excited to spend some time together We arrived at the hotel to checkin at 500 on that Friday afternoon After making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldnt be available for another hour They blamed this on shortage of maids that day They did manage to find us a table in one of their cafes but this wasnt a good start to our special weekend When we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the dollsized travel bed that is included in the package wasnt in the room This disappointed my daughter she was looking forward to that While they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasnt the surprise we had imagined The rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly We managed to have a good time together even though the service wasnt quite what is claimed on the website Would I go to the Talbott Hotel again? Probably not,negative,false
Terrible time at The Talbott When I planned my vacation to Chicago I called ahead and made reservations to stay here When I went to check in I was told I didnt have a reservation knowing my credit card was charged I argued with the guy who was working Finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else Thankfully they knew how to use the computer I go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet I could not believe it when I complained I was told to spray some air freshener I had to go visit family When I got back my room key did not work Once again there I was complaining to the helpless employee He told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet I could not believe the mentality of this guy I had one more night reserved I could not take it anymore and I went and spent the rest of my vacation at my Aunts house I would not recommend The Talbott to anyone,negative,false
I was going on a 3 day personal trip to Chicago and I decided to indulge myself a bit this time around I chose to stay at the Talbot an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago To start off I was NOT pleased For the hundreds I pay a day I expected an impeccable hotel First the checkin process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation I had placed nearly A MONTH in advance Some customer service they claim Next when I went to my room I found that room service had not cleaned it at all I was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such In summary yes it was a fancy hotel yes it had nice accommodations but the service I experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price,negative,false
After a recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago I left the city with an empty pocket book I had booked a package deal online and although the service was absolutely terrific i didnt realize some of the amenities i was paying for included personalized key cards and room service menus I could have done with out my room key having my name printed across it as well as the menu When did my name printed on things become an extra amenity that cost so much money? I basically felt overcharged for the so called extras included in the package i purchased One other thing the traffic was pretty horrible and checking in seems like it could have somehow been made simpler,negative,false
My husband and I were planning our 1st year wedding anniversary and we wanted to go back and spend it in Chicago where we had first met After spending several minutes frustratingly navigating The Talbott Hotels website I FINALLY was able to complete a reservation for a long weekend After a long flight into Chicago we were so ready to check in shower and lay down in our hotel room However once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation I provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied She begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting We then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door Im severely allergic to smoke and we ended up getting a refund and locating a much more accommodating and friendly hotel,negative,false
I recently stayed at The Talbott Hotel for 3 nights and I could not have been more disappointed It was a terrible experience Long wait to check into room since room wasnt ready even though I arrived way after the check in time Front desk was very rude Was given a smoking room when I had requested nonsmoking Room service left a lot to be desired The food took forever to arrive and when it did it was cold and unappetizing The staff at the hotel was not very helpful and was very unfriendly Had no toilet paper in room Room was very noisy Could hear people next door opening doors watching tv talking The room was very dingy small and had a musty odor Needless to say I will not be staying here again nor will I be recommending this hotel to anyone else Stay away from this hotel Not worth the money,negative,false
Id expect a luxury hotel to pay more attention to details The room really hadnt been thoroughly cleaned I found hairballs under the bed the mirrors were streaked etc The desk staff took forever to even acknowledge me when I was checking in three of them two on the phone and nobody even made eye contact for 5 minutes Then they gave the vaguest answers to some pretty basic questions about the neighborhood youd think theyd know where to find a Starbucks The internet was ridiculously slow the whole two days I was there,negative,false
I selected The Talbott for my recent family vacation to Chicago We chose the hotel for its close proximity to Navy Pier and otherwise central location In retrospect the phrase location location location apparently does not apply to hotels Its a good thing the location was so great because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad Upon our arrival our room was not ready The clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation and told us simply that we would have to wait without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready When we finally arrived in the room the sheets were not clean A call to housekeeping proved difficult as I do not speak Spanish The second day of our trip housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our please service sign hung on the door We stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on Michigan Ave When the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order it was cold and not very good Despite these poor impressions the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout My call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in Mumbai They will not receive my business again,negative,false
The Talbott Hotel claims to be Chicagos Premiere Small Luxury Hotel After staying there and experiencing the service environment and the hotel in general I can say with confidence that this just isnt true I arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and I was immediately disappointed No one came to my car to collect my bags and I was forced to lug them inside myself The doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags Once inside the atmosphere was not what I expected The lighting was poor leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building The carpet looked dirty as if it hadnt been vacuumed or washed in quite some time and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage When I arrived at the front desk I was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me After checking in I went up to my room and was once again disappointed The bed was very uncomfortable and I ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water That night I ordered room service The food took 45 minutes to get to my room and when it finally arrived it was cold The fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them I would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends and probably not to my enemies either Stay away,negative,false
The Conrad Chicago hotel had some of the worst service I have ever dealt with I got the Executive Room with a king size bed When I got in the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud I called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me They have a pillow menu which I tried to select from but they were out of over half of them The Ipod dock was not working either Also the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm This hotel is the worst in Chicago and I would never recommend going there,negative,false
The name Conrad the most luxurious of all Hilton hotels should illicit nothing but images of pure elegance and luxury however the Conrad in Chicago IL did obviously not receive the memo Upon entering the hotel we were not greeted by any of the hotel staff Additionally we were not offered any help The desk receptionist was beyond rude Her snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay After getting our card we were finally offered help with our luggage The young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage Strangely he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip He received the tip he deserved which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away Upon first looking at the room it was beautiful However closer inspection revealed that the room had NOT been cleaned since the last visitor had left There was hair in the sink and around the toilet There was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub This fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff Instead I was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards Twohours later someone came into the room to investigate When they saw the mess that had been left they offered a menial apology Still another two hours later housekeeping arrived The level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage In the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit the valet actually brought the wrong car to me I was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me it was certainly an incredible make and model but my better judgment prevailed I informed the valet of his mistake to which he replied Sorry dude I read your ticket wrong I know that he did not smoke in my car but he smelled so strongly of smoke that the smell melted into my seat Luckily its location on Rush will help get out of the terror that is Conrad Chicago There are so many better hotels in Chicago  please spend your money elsewhere,negative,false
Overpriced is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel While it may be in downtown Chicago the room had no view Although I asked for nonsmoking the room reeked of smoke The elevators were very slow and one was not working during my stay There was a stain on the pillow and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken There was a dead bug in the bath tub I was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay My credit card was billed twice and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge I do not recommend this hotel at all,negative,false
This hotel is rather far from the airport and in traffic it took almost 2 hours to get there By that time I was so tired I was just ready to check in to my room I stood in line forever as there was only one person working at the front desk That was only the beginning It was very noisy outside from people constantly walking around I guess its because theyre located in the middle of the downtown area but they could at least make the walls thicker I dont want to hear everything going on in my neighbors room The bathroom was not very clean and one of the towels had a hole in it The toilet ran all night which kept me up along with all the people on the street The restaurant food was horrible and I would rather buy food from a street vendor than to pay the ridiculously high price they charged for a burger Overall I was very disappointed with my stay at the Conrad Chicago,negative,false
Chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers When visiting the Windy City however the Conrad Hotel and Resort is one to avoid While the description promises clean accommodations luxury amenities and deep soaking tubs in relity the rooms fall short of expectations I opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet A bit disappointed I decided to ignore this fact Hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels I made my way to the bathroom While I did find a large deep bathtub there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look Hardly what I expected for the price I paid for the accommodations In the corner of the bathroom I found a reminder of a pevious guest a clump of blond hair The maid service seemed to be lacking Not to be deterred from enjoying my stay I decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen I had been promised Unfortunately the battery to the remote control was dead I called the front desk at my wits end to complain about the issues but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word Overall I would definitely not recommend the Conrad Hotel and Resort in Chicago My room was dirty the staff was unfriendly and the ammenities were few and far between On my next stay in Chicago I will definitely stay elsewhere,negative,false
What a disappointment this hotel was First the checkin desk was understaffed and we had to wait forever to get through the line to check in When we finally got up to our room we opened the door and found someone else was already in it Yes the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone elses room We went back to the clerk who checked us in skipping the still present line which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting and told him the problem However he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us He did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do This took a *very* long time It was a good 1015 minutes until he came back He said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view The hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these but when we got to this new room we found out why these rooms hadnt been taken The room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel We briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel but it was late already so we just decided to make do That was of course until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down Then somewhere around 730am the delivery trucks started showing up making that beepbeep backup sound and all sorts of other noise So much for a good nights sleep I suppose I should say the room itself looked nice but with all the noise from the loading dock who cares We gave up and checked out that morning to find another hotel Definitely not going back here ever again,negative,false
My husband and I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for three nights a Thursday through Saturday Let me say we were less than pleased with our experience We chose to stay in the King Bed Deluxe Room and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations Upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser The room was size was average and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room The major annoyance was how loud people were We came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running That is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel You can expect a loud guest maybe once but every night is ridiculous The service was also extremely sub par We had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work One day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me She completely disregarded the sign did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in It scared me and Im just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing So to sum up we will never stay at the Conrad again we will never recommend it to anyone else and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in Chicago,negative,false
My wife and I stayed at the Conrad Chicago Hilton a few weeks back I had a conference in the Windy City and my wife decided shed come along to do some shopping First off let me say typically I LOVE staying in hotels  any chance I get ill spend it away from home in a comfy hotel bed That said this place was terrible The room had a slight odor to it kind of a fishy smell The people at the front desk were rude to us And I found a soiled pair of womens panties under the bed Gross Not to mention that once we got home we both had bug bites up and down our legs now were worried we brought bedbugs home with us If I could take this trip back I would What a terrible place Shame on you Conrad Hilton shame on you,negative,false
I had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance However I later learned that I had made a poor choice Upon arrival the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk Although when we reached out hotel room we were dissapointed in finding it to be a onebedroom suite My family went back down to demand another room with two queensize beds The clerk after a twenty minute waiting period was able to find us a suitable room Upon entering the room was noticably hot We turned on the air conditioning and after waiting for thirty minutes the room remained muggy and humid I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room They promised a repairman within ten minutes 1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman hadnt shown up They once again promised a speedy repair While waiting I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level but I had to go get them After all this trouble I argued that they should bring it up to me but in the end I wound up going to get it myself After returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes the repair man had not shown up So I called again and within 5 minutes the repairman came He managed to fix the air conditioner but it was about 12am We were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off but as the night went on we noticed another problem The air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds It also emitted a strange odor Upon checking with the front desk we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired There were not available rooms left and being so fed up with this hotels poor service we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel I dont recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time,negative,false
For our anniversary this year my wife and I stayed at the Conrad Were from the suburbs so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us Its expensive so we expect the best for our money This was most definitely not the best for our money It wasnt even a good deal either The problems began right off the bat When we got to our room we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room It was like walking into a dusty attic When I sat down to watch TV it turns out it wasnt even connected to cable or anything I kept changing the channel but it was nothing but static and white noise I even looked for another remote After we left our things we went out for a night in Chicago but coming back the smell seemed to have gotten worse I finally asked the hotel management to come up to our rooms They moved us to a different room but they had no explanation for the smell For a single stay that was more trouble than it was worth,negative,false
Dont ever stay at this hotel Conrad Chicago is the worst hotel you can imagine First of all THE PRICE you not get what you pay for I paid 21750 one night for a room that did not even had a TV thats ridiculous The bathroom did not work and it was nasty the bed sheets seemed like used as if some people slept there and they smelled bad After my experience with Conrad Chicago I will please ask you to reconsider getting a room in this hotel You get better service and accommodations even in a 1 star motel,negative,false
I will never stay at Conrad Chicago again The employees were rude from the begining When I asked for extra towels the lady at the front desk looked like I was an inconveniece The bar staff wasnt much better The maids never came and changed our sheet during our stay Do not go there,negative,false
The Conrad Chicago is a Michelin rated hotel so I was expecting great service and wonderful accommodations Well only one part of that was correct The rooms are indeed nicely furnished but the service was terrible The concierge was unable to find my room reservation I reserved online and even had the email confirmation and wasnt very helpful in getting me a new room I ordered room service and the wait time was so long that the food came up cold I mean I understand that it would take time to get the food prepared and up to my room but really? For the price I paid it was definitely not worth it and I would never use this hotel again,negative,false
I had reservations to check into the Chicago Conrad When we arrived my wife and I were told the hotel was oversold and that I would have to take a double room rather than a king This was a special weekend for my wife and I so this was a big disappointment We were offered a free dinner which we accepted The restaurant was dark and the food was fairly good The tub in the bathroom was clogged with hair and we had to call maintenance to repair This took about an hour to resolve Overall we would not pick this hotel again They should make sure all commitments are met and rooms are in excellent condition We feel it was not a good value,negative,false
I was really excited to be visiting Chicago for the first time and the hotel that was recommended to me was the Conrad Chicago located on Rush Street I wanted a hotel that was conveniently located to all the downtown sites and the Conrad Chicago does not disappoint in that respect However everything else about this hotel could be classified as subpar ranging from the rudeness of the checkin clerks to the roaches that were freely roaming in my room This hotel does not deserve to be on anyones recommended list My first problem was a rude desk clerk who checked me in After asking for three forms of identification most places only ask for a drivers license and asking me twenty questions about the reason for my trip to Chicago she reluctantly gave me a room key I asked if there was a bell cap to help me with my bags and she said if I wanted to wait one would be able to help in about 15 minutes I didnt feel like waiting so I dragged my bags to the room only to find that the room key did not work Instead of dragging everything back down I decided to use my cell phone to call the front desk only there was no cell phone signal in the hall way I couldnt believe I was in the middle of downtown Chicago and the hotel did not have a signal I finally flagged down someone from the housekeeping staff to let me into my room but I immediately saw there were problems Two roaches scampered across the carpet and when I went into the bathroom there were no towels or wash cloths I went to turn on the TV and it didnt work One of the lamps was missing a light bulb I couldnt believe that this was happening to me I was at the Conrad Chicago not the Motel Six I then sat down on the bed and the mattress was soft and lumpy I was ready to cry I was spending a lot of money on this hotel and it was a dump I called down to the front desk and asked for another room but they refused saying I had gotten a special rate and it did not allow room changes I insisted that they give me towels fix the TV put a light bulb in the lamp and have someone spray to get rid of the roaches They agreed but told me it would take awhile because several of their key personnel had called in sick My stay at the Conrad Chicago was a nightmare from beginning to end I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,negative,false
Imagine flying to the windy city for business After a long flight with many delays you get a cab to your hotel the muchhyped Conrad Youve been expecting to fall into a soft bed with a lovely view of the Chicago skyline out your window Thats exactly how I imagined it after my delayed flight and terrible cab ride Thats the opposite of how it turned out I got in to the lobby late and the person at the counter was busy talking on their cellphone I approached and they didnt even hang up They were going on about how they thought the whole Charlie Sheen thing was overblown I dont care Its late I have meetings the next day I try to check in and they say they cant find my reservation This is despite the fact I have my receipt with me Finally they check me in and dont even bother to have a bellhop help me with my bags This isnt a cheap room Its standard to treat your customers with some level of respect I get to my room and I open the door and its someone elses room Somehow theyve given me the wrong room and activated my key for that persons room Worse yet the occupant was passed out drunk on the bed with his clothes strewn all over the room I have to carry my bags back downstairs and get checked into the right room Finally I get up there and my room is missing a pillow Seriously? How can the maid not notice The bed was made Someone mustve been in the room and seen that there was one too few pillows This episode was exemplary of the rest of my stay Needless to say neither I nor my business will be using the services of the Conrad in Chicago,negative,false
My husband and I were really looking forward to spending our anniversary at the Conrad hotel For the price we were paying we were expecting a luxurious hotel with all the amenities unfortunately it was quite the opposite Upon arriving we were greeted by a rude and incompetent receptionist Not only could she not find our reservation due to the fact that she kept misspelling our name but she refused to apologize when she finally did find them and acted as if it was our fault she couldnt spell Our room turned out to be okay except for the stain on my pillow case which ruined the experience for me We ate at the restaurant on site and were less than impressed with the food It was alright but nothing out of this world We felt we could have gotten a better meal elsewhere All in all the Conrad was a big disappointment to both of us,negative,false
I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago Although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites my experience was anything but pleasent First of all they tell you that check in time is at 3pm Well I arrived at the hotel at 330pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready After waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready I decided to go settle in The carpets in the room smelled old and musty Additionally the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips scratches and dents in the furniture Although the bed was comfortable I just couldnt get over the musty smell coming from the carpet It was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep All in all my experience was not the worst Ive ever had but far from anything worth writing home about,negative,false
I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Conrad Chicago Hotel located on North Rush Street As part of the Hilton hotel chain I was confident that I would have a positive experience Unfortunately from the time I walked in the door until the time I checked out I was plagued with nothing but problems When I walked into the hotel I was not greeted by the concierge which is usually a bad sign He was reading a newspaper Then when I announced that I was holding a reservation they desk clerk was unable to find it I had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system but they could not find the room I had reserved Finally they assigned me a room but it was smaller than I had originally requested and it had a bad odor I was very disappointed with the room and its decor The room smelled of stale smoke even though it was on a nonsmoking floor The bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom I had to keep checking to make sure I was really at the Conrad Chicago Surely this was not the way the Hilton chain operates There continued to be problem throughout my stay I asked for a wakeup call and it was 15 minutes late which had me scurrying around so I could make my business meeting I ordered breakfast to be brought to my room and it never showed up  at all And the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm so my shower was short and unsatisfying I decided to check out of the Conrad Chicago a day earlier than originally planned because I was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues Upon my return home I wrote a letter to the hotel manager but never received a reply Because they refused to acknowledge that I had problems I will not be staying at the Conrad Chicago again and will avoid all Hilton Hotels in the future,negative,false
Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary After looking at several hotels in the Magnificent Mile territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad The Conrads website impressed us immediately The pictures of the rooms were lovely they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions not that we were planning to watch much tv We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldnt figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system In any case I picked the deluxe kingsize bed room for two nights in mid September My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online most impressed with the view It cost a pretty penny more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations but her happiness was worth it Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wifes purse when unloading the luggage We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a kingsized room but at an additional cost By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay That ended when we found out that our view was of a back alley service corridor So much for the skyline Overall the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up The spa had very limited hours as well Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams away from the hotel It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a midrange priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms but wouldnt have cleaned out so much of my wallet,negative,false
We booked an American Girl Place package at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Told that wed have a room with a nice view apparently their idea of a nice view is of another building Ended up getting a smoking room when we booked nonsmoking cost us 100 more a night than we were told and staff was incredibly rude at the restaurant Would never recommend coming here for any reason whatsoever,negative,false
I have recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and the visit was most unpleasant This hotel was loud and the staff was very rude All the fancy lights and designs are just a distraction from the snobby people who stay there and the people who work there that seem to hate their jobs The hotel food was old it seemed like they were making it all at once for all the people staying there The beds were hard and uncomfortable and it was an over all bad experience in what looked like a nice place to spend a vacation,negative,false
I just got home from my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel Me and my family were in Chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be When we walked in the door there was a horrid odor Almost like a public bathroom The check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative She would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet When we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting The beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks After the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast The food there tastes and looks like vomit The rest of the weeks stay there was like living in Hell The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel is definitely not a good place to stay It is actually probably on of the worst hotels Ive ever stayed at,negative,false
The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while At almost 500 a night one would expect Traveling with my wife I expected to pay the cost of the room already being outrageous but then I was hit with another 20 charge for her to stay Even with a King bed they only figure in one person to their cost The beds were average and although there was much to do everything cost an arm or a leg It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night I definitely would have stayed somewhere else I guess you live and you learn its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations,negative,false
If you want a 5star hotel with 1star service make sure you book your next Chicago stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park When I checked in to the hotel I had to wait at the desk for over ten minutes with no line I was greeted with no thank you for your patience or anything similar The room was fine but nothing too glamorous or outstanding The internet cost 1495day which is outrageous considering the price of the hotel itself The thing that pushed me over the edge however was the valet parking When I wanted my car in the morning I had to wait 15 minutes to be acknowledged the valets were talking to each other and ignoring me altogether And for this service I was charged 5100night When I went to complain at the front desk they just said that sometimes the valets get overwhelmed and you have to exercise patience I will exercise patience as I check out of this hotel,negative,false
My wife and I live in the Western Suburbs of Chicago For our anniversary we booked a night at the Fairmont based on recommendations from friends While the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations For starters we requested a nonsmoking room which we did receive However the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us While the room was certainly adequate the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included While the latter may seem like a minor offense it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality Finally the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for Chicagos standards In summary the Fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price I am sure we could of done better,negative,false
My stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was by far the worst hotel stay I ever had I would not recommend this hotel to anyone They promised I would be able to relax in the spa area and it was dirty and not relaxing at all When I got to my room I ordered room service and it took them 45 minutes to bring what I ordered I am highly dissatisfied,negative,false
For starters I had trouble reaching the front desk Every time I called it would ring endlessly When finally I did reach someone she was snooty impolite and altogether unhelpful Being from the south and not knowing anything about Chicago I was hoping the staff would have been more helpful in guiding me around such a large metropolitan area As I was there on business I was really looking forward to the WiFi access so that my business activity would go uninterrupted Unfortunately this was not the case After multiple log in attempts I ended up going to a local internet bar As attractive as the rooms and the hotel itself were the complete and utter lack of service and delivering up to expectations was disappointing,negative,false
My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park What I expected to be a very pleasant experience turned out to be a stressful visit We specifically reserved a nonsmoking king room and paid the price for that reservation Upon arrival the hotel did not have any nonsmoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful As we had no other options we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong There wasnt an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I cannot help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out To add insult to injury the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation  something I think they should be specifically trained to do  and did not offer any compensation partial refund or related perk to make up for our great inconvenience Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do Although we paid for the breakfast package we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense Pardon the pun but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotels lack of customer service I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but thus far we have received no satisfaction Needless to say we will not be visiting this property again In fact we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels,negative,false
On a recent business trip to Chicago I had the unfortunate circumstance of staying at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel Upon entrance the lobby is beautiful and the hotel seems very nice However as I approached the check in counter the woman working there was very terse and rude to me They had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when I asked about changing it I was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me After a half hour I finally received the correct room The linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality they were scratchy and had a musty smell Also the bathroom wasnt cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket including a condom and there was no shampoo Also I had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee When I called the front desk to ask for some they told be it was not free and would I like to charge the coffee to my account I found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there,negative,false
My stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Hotel was a short one although it was intended to be for five days it only last two When me and my husband arrived we were met by a valet who knicked our Mercedez The clerkconcierge was on his phone for nearly 5 FULL minutes before he noticed that we were standing in front of him When we checked in we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it We then returned to Lobby and to our dismay the hotel had Double Booked the room After another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a better room The bed was unbearable the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes although it was supposedly a nonsmoking room Too tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep However it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room I needed an Ambien to go to sleep I woke up with backaches the continental breakfast had me in the bathroom most of the day and the maids conveniently forgot to clean our room Me and my husband had had enough and decided to go to the Hyatt,negative,false
Dissapointed with my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park When I looked at its web site I was convinced this was going to be the perfect place for my family and I to spend time in when not gazing the sites in Chicago Boy was I wrong When I first arrived to check in there was no one insight at the desk Finally after about 20 minutes I was approached with no apology for my wait While trying to check in they told me there was a mixup and the room I originally requested was occupied I was given a less spacious room one bed for my wife and I to share with the kids and was told they would voucher my meals that day My wife and I love sushi so we figured we use it on that When we were done not only was the quality of the food mediocre but they told us the voucher would not work for the sushi bar Worst display of customer service I have ever received and will never stay there again,negative,false
My experience with the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was Terrible I arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour I chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed I sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink I received was warm When the room was finally ready I was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding When I called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom After all this hassle I would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered I found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 1395 for a 24 hour period I was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels I have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access Overall I was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel any time soon,negative,false
On my recent weekend stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel i was very disappointed I chose this hotel after scouring various hotel websites in the area From the look of the website my expectations were above average I felt the website led one to believe it was upscale Upon my arrival i checked in I was shown my room and at first glance everything seemed fine with the room As i was settling into the room I began to notice a general lack of cleanliness I noticed spiderwebs in corners and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom Also it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room however it did not work and I had to call down for them to bring a replacement I as a guest should not have had to call down these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in I found the restaurants on site to be crowded loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal I did inquire about a few of the menu items and my waiter seemed to have a lack of knowledge about the menu items Overall my experience was not good and the next time I am in the area I will chose another hotel for my stay,negative,false
Stayed at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and it was not a good experience The room had been cleaned in a haphazardly fashion and was not pleasant to walk into When I called the service desk for more towels to be brought up into the room it took an exceedingly long amount of time for them to be brought up and the woman who delivered the towels was as rude as can be Will not be staying at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park again,negative,false
Whenever I decided to stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park the only thing that I had on my mind was the idea of taking that time to relax and enjoy some time with my husband However the hotel choice wasnt the best Right in the front desk when we arrived there we had problems with our reservation The room that we had reserved was occupied and so we had to switch to some other room which was much smaller than the original one The hotel did give us a discount but if Id paid for the large room was because I wanted the it A hotel with this name shouldnt put its guests in these kind of situation I wont be reserving room there again,negative,false
My experience as Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was horrible Me and my wife were on a road trip from New York and stopped had reservations for Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel We arrived at 1200 AM and they did not have a nonsmoking room available for which we booked My wife was pregnant at the time and the reception staff had no sympathy My wife couldnt handle the smell of the room so I asked for a refund to go stay somewhere else They refused and were very rude and unhelpful We had to stay the night and the first thing next morning we did was leave and look for a different hotel I will never stay at this hotel again,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that I ever had One of the main reasons why I had originally booked my stay at the Fairmont was because the property offered special pure rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic Because I suffer from extreme allergies  and I really hate the thought of a lessthanpristine hotel room  I was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities Ill tell you this right now  save your money When I got to my room I immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold To add to the gross factor I took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet The comforter on the bed looked messy as well  as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it There was no way I was going to stay in this room so I made my way back to the checkin desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room The woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer After making me wait for another twenty minutes she finally informed me that they could put me in another room but it would be a four hour wait Four hours It was absolutely ridiculous No hotel  much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service  should ever treat any of its customers this way I do not recommend the Fairmont nor will I ever stay there again,negative,false
The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was supposed to be our romantic get away and it turned into a nightmare When we got there our room wasnt done We were not offered anything to do drink or eat in the meantime and we had to wait well over the 20 minutes that they said it would be finished The clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone How rude We were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done And after waiting that long for the room can you believe it? There was a dirty towel in the bathroom The television didnt work we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it Plus the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair Im so mad Im writing the owners and letting them know This really made me mad We havent taken a vacation in years and I was expecting the Fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs Even the concierge snickered at my boots so what I like to wear Doc Martens It makes me mad even thinking about the Fairmont At least my time in Chicago was enjoyable even though our hotel was more than lame,negative,false
On a recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millemmium Park Hotel I was appalled at the service I received at such a supposedly high end hotel When I arrived I had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in Apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with Finally I was given the key to my nonsmoking room away from the vending area Much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and I heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight And the room was obviously a room for smokers The blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke I of course complained but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but I was welcome to check out and go to another hotel After a fitfull nights sleep I awoke to children running up and down the hallway Their parents were no where in sight My shower was cold and had no pressure I was given two towels one of which had not been laundered I could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it I cannot understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark,negative,false
The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chicago was the worst hotel I ever went to I booked a nonsmoking room online and they went ahead and gave me a room that smoking was allowed After going in my room I smelled heavy smoke smell It was really bad I called the front desk about the issue and they said they had nothing like that on record and refused to exchange rooms for me There was also blood stains on my bed sheets The carpet was also dirty I would never book at that Hyatt again,negative,false
During my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago I was severely disappointed in the quality of the facility and its staff To start off the rooms did not provide an adequate sound barrier between rooms Hoping to spend a quiet evening after a long day of business meetings I had hoped to spend a quiet night in My neighbors however watching what I can only imagine was a Real House Wives of New Jersey marathon on full volume destroyed my chance for peaceful ambiance When I asked the concierge to address the issue he seemed more concerned about his texting than doing his job As I visited the gym I found their stateoftheart StayFitTM gym consisted in nothing more than a couple of treadmills weights and yoga mats The water in the cooler was quite warm and the workout towels were stained and tattered Finally all the hypoallergenic features touted on their website were rendered null by the presence of dust balls under the beds,negative,false
There is a great difference between a Hyatt Regency Hotel and a normal hotel The thing that I did not like about this hotel was the smoke section of the non smoking section was really close to each other I get really uncomfortable when I am in a crowded area and people are smoking their lungs out Even though this hotel is really glamourous has a nice bar a nice restaurant great music it is still not a good stay if you dont like people smoking beside you,negative,false
The room was very pretty and the location is great but the hotel is so big and they dont have the staff to take care of everything The heating in our room was loud making it difficult to sleep The gym is not big enough and the hotel parking garage is very expensive The hotel has so many guests that the lobby was too loud to relax in We didnt get great service at the hotel bar and the bar ran out of bar snacks because so many people were in the bar area Later we asked for directions to the restaurant we had dinner reservations at and the hotel staff we asked did not know how we could get there The next morning the cleaning staff tried to get in while we were still in the room,negative,false
My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that Ill never ever forget  not in a good way Checkin was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant I went up to my room and looked around all seemed ok at first I was bushed so I flopped on the bed ohhhhh noooooo The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days But I was so tired that I just passed out Of course I woke up with a back achegreat I figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub turned the hot water on full force and poured in some shower gel I put my foot in expecting some real heat  the water was barely lukewarm I called the front desk but they were no help the clerk just apologized Frustrated at this point I turned on the tv and switched on the air I put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent It looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something I couldnt take anymore of this I went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk It seemed as though the guy was on something  he kept smiling as he apologized no empathy as if hes used to hearing about the goop in the ac He offered me a free night but there is no way that Id stay at this place again  ever,negative,false
when i first checked the hotels website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there but i was totally disappointed once i got there first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor  and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that then when i was trying to enjoy the view they windows were all dusty and dirty so i decided to get out of the room  and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture  so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww its all i can say about this hotel,negative,false
A friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her Birthday The hotel at first glance was very nice and charming But We quickly found out that was not the case Our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in The bathroom was filthy it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks There was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror There were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room We immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly unkempt room The women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling was not smoke because that is not permitted in the hotel We were also told that room was cleaned that day After several minutes of arguing with her and a manager we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time WE had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us The food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and WAY over priced Our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there All the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests I will never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to any one,negative,false
Hyatt Regency Chicago seemed like a nice place to stay but we didnt like it very much The renovations were cheap and poorly done our bathroom faucet was leaky and the carpet had bumps in it The staff was RUDE I was trying to find a good cab service and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for 20 minutes while he was finishing a phone call Couldnt he have at least called someone else to help me? The Babies Travel Lite gave us the wrong sized diapers so we had to go find some anyway and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way,negative,false
Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town but alas I was left disappointed I arrived in the afternoon my flight having been delayed ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening Unfortunately my room was not ready It should have been ready hours earlier but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff In any event I was advised to wait in the bar creatively named BIG Bar They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishmentI wanted only to relax in my room I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk Was my room ready yet? What room? they replied To my astonishment it seemed that I no longer had a reservation How this came to pass I do not know and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned or furnished or renovated or whatever they were doing to make it ready but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer who spake Guest Not Found or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters I requested the manager who was unavailable presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either Finally I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel with fewer regrets than I would have imagined to find a better place to spend the nighta park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point As it was I found another hotel better priced better staffed and with rooms ready for my custom So if you are looking an experience like no other book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago If you want a place to sleep look elsewhere,negative,false
The Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like theyre staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby In other words come here for the looks not the amenities They make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special degermifying process you know because a simple washing machine just isnt good enough To me this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being richwhich most of them are not Meanwhile the hotel doesnt even offer free wirelessan essential feature for business travelers like me Obviously Im not the intended consumer though so I guess I shouldnt be surprised,negative,false
I have recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel and although I have stayed there a variety of times before for both business and pleasure my experience this time was particularly poor From right when I checked in to the day I left I felt like I was constantly around unfriendly people who didnt want to be at work their to do their jobs My room was dirty the whole time even though the maid came every day and when I was trying to sleep at night it was so loud in the hallways I couldnt sleep For my next visit to Chicago I wont be staying at the Hyatt Regency,negative,false
My wife and I went to Chicago to enjoy our weekend and stayed at Hyatt Regency Hyatt Regency Chicago has ruined our family holiday weekend First of all if you are not a diamond or platinum member you need to reserve the room atleast 1015 days in advance You have to pay extra 20 for the welcome credit option They will give you a credit of 75 for the 2 days We only used 20 and the rest was forefeited I talked to the manager and he said we cant use it on our next visit The management of the hotel is full of cheap minded people When you know most of the hotels let you use their wifi for free Hyatt Regency management asked us to pay for using their wifi Beware of this place if you want to enjoy your weekend in Chicago Hyatt Regency should be the last place you should consider staying Thanks Sam,negative,false
Hyatt Regency Hotel Good ole Downtown Chicago Hypoallergenic rooms are usually intended for the wellbeing of even the worst cases of allergen sufferers Well when we got to our room one of the first things my wife did was sneeze four times Upon setting up the channel scanning which the reception came in fuzzy all around there was an interattive ethernet feature that after lost in confusion of how to work it provided us with our first fee The pool was in bad shape The maids seemed to come and go with no intercommunicative qualities just knock knock knock We let em right in as they started vacuuming One of the fluorescent bulbs on the ceiling was dimmer than the others and the Gideons Bible had crib notes What a room Not to mention what the hotel was like Oh geez,negative,false
Whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas Most notably is cleanliness as although the lobby was very clean the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not Dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time The furnishings were nice and modern but with various blemishes upon close inspection Bathroom was relatively clean with the exception of the shower View was nice for this particular room and service was relatively quick The food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue This time with the glasses which were stained the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel I will not make the mistake of staying here again,negative,false
My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago a couple of weeks ago and will most defiantly not go back The customer service is horrible and it is well apparent that most of the workers did not want to be there either When we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key When we got into the room the bed was not even properly made The cafe is always crowded with people and it take two hours to get food We ended up going home two days before we planned,negative,false
This hotel was full of drunks The lobby was full of crowds at night and the bar was way too busy There were people stumbling all over the hotel at all hours of the night yelling in the hallways making lots of noise The staff had little to say I wasnt aware of the noise level when I booked the room and when I threatened to make other reservations the people in the lobby had nothing to say We asked for a water view and got a city view Again the people at the front desk werent accomodating at all Overall we had a horrible experience,negative,false
We decided to spend a little extra to stay at this hotel while visiting our son in Chicago Wont make that mistake again The rooms are smaller than they appear on the web creative photography and the place is dirtyWeve stayed at Best Westerns that are cleaner The air conditioner is super loud  and the walls are paper thin The people in the next room must have been having a party and despite three calls to the front desk between 1 and 3 am Security failed to stop the ruckus Also thought the front desk staff was rude Usually in Hyatts Hiltons etc the staff is polite and tries to be accommodating These people werent particularly personable  we seemed to be an interruption of their work rather than the reason for it The only positive about the hotel was the location  but that doesnt make up for the negative experience Save some money and stay somewhere else,negative,false
I expected a bit more from the Hyatt Regency Chicago I stayed at recently I was appalled of the conditions of the room we stayed in The linens were not clean the toilet paper roll was nearly empty with no spare left and there was a lock on the door that didnt function The turndown service left me no chocolate on my pillow and I think they took a few more pieces of the already nearly empty toilet paper again with out leaving a spare I would not stay there again Traveler beware,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago IL and boy was I surprised The hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious In fact the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating As if this were not enough the bathroom of my room looked like it hadnt been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the fresh towels Towards the end of my stay I saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel in downtown Chicago During my three days there I experienced the worst service of my life We made reservations beforehand and upon arrival our room was already booked It took us nearly two hours to actually get into our room After being given the wrong key When we entered the room the sheets were stained with what seemed to be cherry koolaid I am going to assume that it wasnt After a night on the town we were bummed for money by three homeless men outside the hotel After arriving in our room and hoping for a nice hot shower we found a note on our door with a sorry note explaining they didnt have any hot water Early the next morning we were awoken by housekeeping we had a DND sign on our door So we decided to wake up and go out for breakfast Comes to find out our car was broken into in their parking garage We filed a police report and the police asked the managers for a video of the surveillance Unfortunately for us their surveillance was out of memory to record anymore Needless to say we left early the next day and I will never return to such a dreadful hotel ever again,negative,false
I was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation but unfortunately that was not to be had From the moment we arrived at the Omni the staff was belligerent and extremely rude They had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before If we werent so tired we wouldve gone to a different hotel right then but hindsight is 2020 After we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby we decided to go down to the pool which was tiny and kind of dirty so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing The internet access was really slow I will NEVER stay here again Save yourself the headache and book somewhere else,negative,false
During my latest business trip both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in ChicagoIllinois at one of their Deluxe suites Unfortunately and I think I speak for both of us we were not fully satisfied with the hotel The hotel advertises luxurylevel accommodations and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures the service is certainly subpar When one plans a stay at such an establishment they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in First of all the airconditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on the air coming out seemed musty Second of all the fitness center was only open until 1030 pm For people who like to exercise after dinner this can certainly be a problem Especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight For these as well as other similar reasons I would not recommend this hotel if one is looking for luxury accommodations,negative,false
Did not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel Firstly the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful There was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle Secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees Considering I paid well over 250 per night for the Romance package reservation it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon,negative,false
I had never been to Chicago and was looking forward to sightseeing after my business conference My company had arranged for me to stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel located in the center of the Magnificent Mile Once I arrived at the hotel and gave it the once over I was pleased but not impressed Once I put down by luggage and inquired about my reservation I was told that my room was not ready yet and that thered be an hour delay I tried not to lose my temper and pleasantly asked if I could have another room I was told there was a convention going on in the hotel and every room was filled I would have left but my company had a account at this hotel If I stayed somewhere else Id have to pay out of pocket The service employee behind the counter flippantly told me to take a seat and went back to talking with his gumchewing coworker I picked up my luggage and plopped down in a cushy chair that wobbled The leg in front on the left side was broken I picked up my luggage and moved to another chair Two hours passed by before I was given my room When I walked into the room the first thing I smelled was cigarette smoke I was mad because I explicitly asked for a nonsmoking room I was furious I didnt feel like going back downstairs and dealing with the idiot behind the counter and I was tried from my long flight I sighed tipped the bellboy and slammed the door to my room I thought maybe I could use the air conditioning to freshen the room When I went to turn it on it didnt work Tired and angry I went to sleep thinking Ill never stay at this hotel again,negative,false
The Omni Chicago Hotel was in one word dreadful The hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic The service is terrible If you want to wait for your room for 3 and a half hours this is the place to go Throughout a whole week beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned The hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit they give no info for any activities going on in Chicago This hotel should be listed in the top 10 WORST hotels in America Do not waste your time nor money staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel,negative,false
After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel I can honestly say that I will take the time to book a room ahead of time on my next visit to Chicago We were thrilled to see how beautiful the hotel was at first because it seemed like it would be a nice place The outside of the hotel was pristine but our room was filthy We requested a nonsmoking room but it had obviously been smoked in before as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air In fact we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be nonsmoking but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well To top it off room service brought us the wrong item When we checked out we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item even after we sent it back I would also have to point out that Michigan Avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class Right outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes I couldnt even go to the gas station after 8 pm because I was too scared to leave the hotel The pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to For the price of the room I would say this place was a definite disappointment I have learned my lesson to check out the room before I agree to stay in it next time This place gets 12 of a star from me,negative,false
After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently I was nothing but disappointed This luxury hotel obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable When I arrived my hotel room was devoid of towels and after calling down to the front desk it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered On top of that when I went to connect to the internet in my room the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their superior corner suite I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn and after this stay I wish I had,negative,false
First off dont get a room on a lower floor the garbage pick up makes a ton of noise and wakes you up at 6 am Then dont bother going down for breakfast at that time either because the restaurant isnt open that early When it finally opened the breakfast arrived cold and late Nothing like congealed eggs to start your day The fitness center had no towels and no cups for water It was also too hot and too many people had sweated too much in it After my congealed breakfast it really was not pleasant My entire three day visit was like that I tried room service that night but again service was very slow and the food not warm when it arrived My high speed internet was not so high speed when it would connect me at all The furniture was run down and worn Pool towels were not always available Generally for the price I paid I would expect better service and a better maintained premises,negative,false
I had such a horrible experience when I stayed at Omni Chicago Hotel last Saturday night First of all the plasma TV in my room was broken and the staff said they had no other rooms available and they werent particularly apologetic about it either Secondly it was supposedly a nonsmoking hotel but as an exsmoker I can tell that people had smoked in the room recently Additionally the indoor swimming pool was closed due to high chlorine levels which was really disappointing because I was looking forward to using the pool Finally checkout was supposed to be at noon At 1115 am the maid was knocking at the door She asked if I would be out soon and I thought was very quite intrusive I will never ever stay at that place again,negative,false
Last week I booked a Deluxe Suite at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago I took the Retreat and Relax package deal The wait to check in was intolerably long because they were letting some people check in with a dog Im allergic to dogs and Im sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in They insisted on escorting me to to my room every time I came in like I was going to break into another guests room or something I swear anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks asking me if I needed anything You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think youre up to something I went to the pool but it was full of screaming children When I went to bed I could hear the television in the next room through my wall And whats worse they wouldnt even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress They threatened to throw me out on the street after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars I had to go outside probably where the dog went to piddle to do it Also their onsite restaurant is too expensive given that youre already paying an arm and a leg for the room The food should be free I wouldnt stay here again it was a waste of my money,negative,false
When my boyfriend and I checked into our room at the Omni Chicago we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled as if kids had been jumping on it That was just the first of our issues The glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them and I saw a deadthank goodness roach behind the toilet We were given the hotel night stay by a friend so we decided to just deal with it We ordered some munchies from the kitchen and the chips were stale and the dip smelled sour After coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies we were able to enjoy our staybut I would not recommend this place to anyone,negative,false
Recently staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel was a waste of money The rooms are typical standard roomsunless you want to pay an unreasonable amount for one of the premier rooms the service from the staff was nothing to rave about unless your ideal idea of service is waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes waiting for anybody to help you carry your heavy luggage up to your room Sorry to say in short I think my money would have been better spent staying at a HoJos,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel and it was awful When I arrived my room was not ready Two hours later when it was finally cleaned I entered and saw they they had not brought the cot that I had requested for my son I asked for it again but they never brought it My mattress was uncomfortable and I did not like sharing it with my son The AC did not even work and it was terribly hot in the room The next morning we ate the continental breakfast before leaving and it too was bad There was cereal low quality yogurt and burnt flavorless muffins I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,negative,false
I have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel The Omni Chicagos age shows and not in a great ambiance way The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking I say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor almost like mildew that permeated the first room we were given Seriously it brought tears to my eyes The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma but finally agreed to switch us to another room The new one didnt smell but was clearly past its prime Housekeeping was almost nonexistent We had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels How can you forget to leave towels for the guests? Im not one to complain but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment We received neither and will not be returning to the Omni Chicago,negative,false
The Omni Chicago Hotel is not pretty as they advertise it First of all it really difficult to get there because its located in down town Chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare If you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you When I arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in and I thought the wait time was ridiculous To make matters worse I need internet connection and the day I was there they had technical problems and the Internet was not working in my room Two hours later they managed it get to work the connection was still very slow For my part the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations I was disappointed and will never stay there again if I go back to Chicago If was rating it I would give it 12 star out of 5,negative,false
Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here At first once coming into the room there was a mildewy smell in the air which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all To make matters even worse the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon when my wife was back from exploring the city This was simply unacceptable by any standard,negative,false
Dont stay here My family and I stayed here for a weekend trip The staff were rude and acted like we were bothering them The rooms looked nice in photographs but when we got there our room looked like it hadnt been dusted in ages Overall bad service and not worth the money,negative,false
I will never stay here again I was lured in by the hotels pictures showing a fabulous suite Instead I arrived to find cheap furniture that smelled of old cheese I called the front desk to see if there was another room available I was put on hold for five minutes and no one came back on the line I ended up going to the front desk myself I was ignored and not given assistance until I interrupted the front desk clerk who seemed to be on a personal call The clerk apologize but then looked at me with an attitude when I requested another room because mine smelled like old cheese I was informed that there were no other rooms available but that they would send up housekeeping Housekeeping sprayed some Febreeze on the couch and then left I tried to relax by turning on the TV in the bedroom I sat on the bed and saw something scurry under the pillow I checked the corner of the mattress and found bedbugs I packed up my bags and left after that I did get a refund on the room after some complaining I went across town to the Marriott where I had a much better stay,negative,false
I would never stay here again For a hotel that calls itself a fourdiamond hotel it cannot even provide the most basic amenities and services I would have been more comfortable staying in a rundown motel The bathroom had not been cleaned properly and the sheets were stained,negative,false
I was extremely disappointed with my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel It was a hot summer day and I turned on the shower and only drips of hot water came out I called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it I felt the person I spoke to was rude to me They were not accepting responsibility but talking down to me as if I was stupid After waiting 30 minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower This was not a service person He could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem I was having He expected a tip and complained when I did not give him one Nobody came up after that I was told I could switch to a different room so I had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor The shower did work in this other room but I didnt have the view of the city that I had in the first room I was looking at a brick wall Plus there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night I complained and the hotel staff told me they were VIPs and could not do anything about the noise This hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable Do not go to the Omni Hotel Ive stayed in 50 a night motels with better service,negative,false
My stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago was without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences in my live I was there for a week long conference Although my reservations had been made months in advance they did not have a suite for me when I arrived resulting in having to stay in another hotel for the first night Once my room was ready I was disappointed by the cleanliness and the limitation of the kitchen barely large enough to move around and very few utensils to cook with The pool was only open for limited hours and I should not have bothered bringing a swimsuit At night I was kept awake by the noise coming from adjacent rooms and the traffic outside My overall experience was a stay in an overpriced suite I will not book here ever again,negative,false
My husband and I were sorely disappointed in this hotel We had requested a non smoking room and right off we were hit with the stinch of stale cigarettes when we opened the door The front desk was not responsive to our needs at all but we did finally get moved to a new room The water pressure in the shower was hardly enough to get the shampoo out of our hair and the beds were lumpy I was very disappointed in the workout room it was very small so I decided to swim laps instead but when I got to the pool it didnt look like it had been maintained all week Needless to say we wont make the mistake of staying with Homewood Suites again,negative,false
Atrocious Heres our story My wife and I are Californians but met as students at the University of Chicago To celebrate our 10th anniversary we decided to travel back to the Windy City and revisit all of the places we frequented when we were first falling in love When it came to lodging we knew we wanted a suite but little else mattered We wanted to revisit the city and didnt intend to spend very much time in our room As a result we didnt spend very much time researching hotels Big mistake Our stay at Homewood Suites could not have been worse Our room which I should mention took a full two hours for them to prepare even though we had booked it months in advance was filthy My wife found a dead cockroach in the bathroom The staff was rude and indifferent The chocolates included in the Romance Package could not have cost the hotel more than a dollar Cleaning staff failed to show up Front desk offered apologies but little else Suffice it to say we checked out early Never before have I seen such a poorlymanaged hotel Truly shameful Stay away,negative,false
I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week and I was extremely disappointed with my experience The breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked I came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted Also the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm having been kept out on the counter I would have been better off bringing my own food Also the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward I had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways I could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed It just wasnt what I would expect from a Hiltonbrand hotel suite,negative,false
I stayed with my husband at the Homewood Suites in Chicago We wanted to do something nice for our anniversary and thought that the Hilton was a solid name brand and expected to have a pleasant stay Unfortunately this was not the case The staff was very rude at checkin which took 20 minutes and the lobby smelled musky and gross The room itself was not like other Hilton hotels I have stayed at The carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit the room smelled of smoke even though its advertised as smokefree and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed I was so grossed out that I had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it And dont even get me started on how poorly the showerbathtub workeda nice anniversary went totally awry due to how crummy this hotel is If I could give it 0 stars I would,negative,false
DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her When I finally got into my room I was appalled I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room which I was advised that I was I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one One I entered my new room I found that once again it stank of smoke but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning BAD IDEA I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs I packed my stuff and checked out that night however a refund was refused I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response DO NOT STAY HERE,negative,false
I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hiltons famous hotels I gotta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to In fact Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape In fact the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room they ignored me How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo didnt look like the actual logo It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw Ill never go to this hotel again and it wont even be in a million years for that matter This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer,negative,false
I really had high hopes for Homewood Suites when I stayed there on a weeklong business trip last month After all considering their prices its technically a Hilton you would expect something above and beyond a typical cutrate bargain motel Ill start with the good stuff about the hotel its in downtown Now for the bad stuff first everyone is rude Im not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp The bellboy scowled at me in the lobby was rough with my luggage and then scowled at me again when I tipped him 5 Likewise the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head She had to call her supervisor over *twice* just to check me in and I had a reservation Apparently she was new and didnt have much experience using the computer but thats no excuse it turned what would have been a twominute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium Sadly the room was no better than the service The hot water in the sink did not work the shower was only lukewarm and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink Complimentary mood lighting I guess The TV was a bust sure it was an LCD but the ESPN logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel And to top it all off the bed smelled funny I called the front desk at least the phone worked and asked for fresh sheets The person I talked to said theyd be right up but never came Eventually I gave up I woke up the next morning to back pain the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow I left the room and made my way through the chilly hallways to the complimentary buffet Literally all the food was bad Even the cereal tasted stale Looking around everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience The sight of twodozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watereddown scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel Just plain sad Worst part was it was the same thing for the next four days too,negative,false
Whatever you do do NOT stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago I made that mistake and it was terrible The bed linens were obviously not clean  there was even a stain on the comforter  and the housekeeping staff there absolutely did not care about doing a good job Our room was only cleaned twice in a weeks stay and even then only the barest minimum of effort seemed to go into it They didnt even empty the trash cans As for the insuite kitchen it was awful We were hoping to save money by cooking in our room but with one broken eye on the stove and a nasty greasy microwave? It seemed a better idea to eat out and avoid any more unpleasant surprises from their lackluster inhouse food I didnt hear good things about their breakfast offerings anyways If I were you Id avoid this place like the plague I know Im certainly never going back,negative,false
Our vacation was highlighted by a four day stay at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago DowntownI believed it would be the best part of the trip I discovered it was an unfolding nightmare While in our lovely room on the fifteenth floor a voice emanating from the phone informed us of the pending fire alarm and what procedures to follow Anyone above the tenth floor was instructed to go into the bathroom wet towels and place them along the bottom of the closed doorDo not use the elevators and wait for further instructionsWe nervously waited for twenty minutes without any further communications from the voice in the phoneWe then decided to exit via the stairs realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells doors behind you were lockedWe continued to travel downward against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakersObviously we were rescued without any physical injuries yet emotionally we were damagedI now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less,negative,false
This place was absolutely foul From the minute I walked in I knew making a reservation here was a mistake The person at the counter would barely make eye contact with me and acted like I was asking a huge favor of them in order to check in The room we requested a room with double beds was not available They told me that when I made the reservation requesting double beds was a request and not a guarantee Whats the point of making a reservation then? When we got to the room the room was totally gross The decor was dated the carpet was torn in spots and the whole place smelled musty and almost moldy The bathroom had spots and stains all over it I hesitate to think of the true cleanliness of the sheets The complimentary fitness area was a joke One broken treadmill and a couple of mismatched dumbbells Thanks but no thanks We will definitely not return,negative,false
My husband and I planned a romantic getway for past several months and was looking forward to spending the end of the summer in Chicago However our excitement soon turned to disappointment and frustrations upon our arrival The hotel was quite charming when we walked in the door but then everything went wrong The gentleman checking us in could not find our reservation and was quite impatient and rude once we showed our confirmation papers The manager did make accomondations for us after much discussion back and forth We did not have towels in the room when we checked in and it took at least an hour and several phone calls before the towels were sent to our room Needless to say I was extremely tired and wanted nothing more than to take a warm shower and turn in If we had not paid the total cost up front we would have just left and check into another hotel,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown and found it lacking in the quality of their service The rooms are nice and well furnished but the service lacks in some areas Some of the complimentary services include fastspeed wireless internet access cardiofitness and indoor pool grocery shopping service and coffee tea hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobbys 24 hour convenience shop However the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned The grocery shopping service was alright although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality Rating this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5 I would give it a 3 at best,negative,false
I dont know how this hotel ever got such high ratings from others This hotel was for me over priced fingerprints on the walls stains in the bathroom funky loud people in the hallway early in the morning parkingvalet was time consuming and same thing with the elevator The back to the 1960s furniture is not for me and what about the breakfast? Better to skip their proteinless stuff they had to offer Oh sure it is a Hilton woopee You pay for the privilege of sleeping there Saw a couple of bed bugs but took a shower in the morning and they seemed to wash away I wont be back to Hilton Homewood Suites again Id rather stay somewhere outside the city to save money Think that Ill be happier as well,negative,false
Oh my goodness this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown Chicago It all went well enough checking in but them went downhill There was so much left to be desired The biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet I kid you not I guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it I just dont know But for the prices they charge this type of thing is unacceptable Most everything else about the actual room was as expected The noise was a bit more than Im used to though but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us So we asked to be moved to another room they did get us in another room but that took nearly 2 hours The second room worked out well for us but I wont be risking staying here again Plus the pool was not available I really wish they would have mentioned that on their website I was looking forward to it for days All in all it is a beautiful place in a wonderful location but they need to work on their customer service before Ill reconsider staying at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown,negative,false
I was in business in Chicago so I decided to choose what I thought would be a relaxing hotel to treat myself a bit I should have known when the woman at the front desk rolled her eyes when I asked for some of the complimentary apple cider advertised She told me Its by the signs in a youidiot kind of voice Too bad the signs were too far away from me to read without my glasses I was ashamed and did not ask for anything from the front desk again The room itself was horribly decorated and nothing special The Im too ugly to steal furniture patterns and colors did not say luxury to me I went down to relax by the pool with my laptop to get some work done Unfortunately the pool was overrun with about five rowdy kids No parents in sight I would have reported them to the front desk but was shamed by the aforementioned apple cider incident Thank God I left my laptop in its case or it would have been ruined by all of the water that was splashed on me The free breakfast tasted like cardboard it was something akin to a free breakfast at a 60anight hotel I only tried it once because it made me feel sick when I ate it The only good thing about my experience was leaving this overpriced motel behind to go to work,negative,false
Not worth the price I had the unfortunate experience of staying in the Hilton Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago I stayed there with my family while we were on vacation I wish I would have saved my money and went somewhere else With a hotel this expensive you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way like complimentary parking Not a chance In addition to the 259 price tag I also had to pay 30 for parking per night If I had stayed at the Motel 6 parking would have been free The staff there were not very nice at all When I registered the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time She was very rude to me Perhaps she was having a bad day or something but I doubt it After I arrived in my room my key card didnt work and I had to go back downstairs to get it fixed once again interrupting her precious free time with some actual work The rooms had some nice features like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television I didnt go on vacation to cook though The television didnt get very many channels and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies of course I tried logging into Facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room but the complimentary internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using I get a better connection at Starbucks They offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast but its nothing to write home about Ive had better food at McDonalds The food was pretty cold and the choices are very limited Traffic around the hotel was hideous This hotel is downtown and you can definitely tell There are a bunch of oneway streets around which makes getting in and out confusing The room was pretty clean but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges If youre looking for a hotel in Chicago Id say save some money and go somewhere else Ive had better stays at the Best Western and many other hotels that cost less,negative,false
Homewood Suites is a Hilton Group Hotel located in downtown Chicago Though close to many sights when we visited there was extensive construction going on along Michigan Avenue so every morning we were awakened right at 8 am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers We reserved the basic suite Though we arrived at 5 pm well past checkin time our room was not ready for 30 minutes The management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience Once the suite was ready it was nice But then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom We were relocated to another room with apologies but again no offer of compensation for the trouble Once we were finally settled the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer The food was okay but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point The staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service We though it was a good idea since we were already so tired Unfortunately it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected All in all we were disappointed with our experience at Homewood suites We understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable I would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting Chicago,negative,false
After considering several hotels in the area my family and I finally decided unfortunately on Homewood Suites for our long weekend vacation Overall the experience left much to be desired The breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries The linens on one of our beds seemed dirty and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude I would not come back here ever,negative,false
I stayed three nights recently at the Hilton Homewood Suites Downtown Chicago Overall I cant rate this establishment highly The person at the front desk was disorganized and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation Once I finally got my key the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me It didnt get any better when I got to my suite The bed was poorly made and I found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows The room was very stuffy and I swear might have even had a vague pet smell My shower was not very clean notable hard water stains on the shower doorand the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip Also the carpets didnt seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable I also visited their small gymworkout area and was disappointed there also It had limited equipment that was in poor repair The floor in there was even slippery which made it a definite trip hazard While the indoor pool looked good as I dipped into it the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell All in all the amenities the unfriendly service and the substandard cleanliness makes this hotel one I would definitely not recommend to anyone When that is paired with their sky high room rates its just not a place that should earn any repeat guests,negative,false
I stayed at the Knickerbocker Hotel the last time I visited Chicago I lived in Illinois during college and as I was on a college budget most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown For my visit back I decided I would treat myself to a nicer stay than I was used to so I booked a room at the Knickerbocker Everything looked nice when I got there but for the price I paid I was really expecting something far above and beyond what I got Maybe I wasnt dressed right or didnt carry the right luggage but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when I checked in Shouldnt a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome? When I stayed at the cheap hotels in college the front desk employees were always friendly when I checked in and out and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city Here I didnt even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because I didnt want to deal with the eye rolling and too important to be bothered attitude I got when I checked in I guess the location was more convenient than the hotels I used to visit but I really thought that part of the money I was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience Look obviously I can afford to stay at your hotel I already booked and paid for the room Even if customer service isnt your number one goal making money should be pretty high up on the list and making a paying customer feel unwelcome isnt a very good way to secure return business I doubt Ill stay here again,negative,false
After a my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I contemplated the the poor quality of my experienc there and felt the need to document it While the amenities were plush the service of the staff was lacking Upon check in my reservation was lost and it took over 30 minutes for the manager to make arraingments for my stay There was no offer to upgrade me or comp me in any way Room service did a poor job in cleaning my room and left wet towles in the bath room A used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out I am not sure my sheets were changed out When I checked out the bell hop dropped my laptop and destroyed my hard drive leaving me to scramble to recover the report I spent days creating Overall my negative experience has left me wondering if they train thier staff on the proper way to attend to their customers I will be relunctant to stay with them again until I am assured they have focused on trainging their staff better,negative,false
Not one of my better experiences When I first arrived at the hotel and tried to get my room key it was discovered that they were fresh out of keys I had to wait half an hour while someone ran out to get more keys It wouldnt have been as bad but the lobby looked to be in slight disrepair When I finally got to the room I found the burnt out light bulb and an unmade bed The room was an ok size for one person but any more than that and it would probably get a bit crowded But the view from the window was amazing and it took away some of the bad for me Overall it just felt like the owners of the hotel stopped caring maintenance took four or so hours to finally come fix the light I didnt even get housekeeping my entire stay there I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone in the area hopefully it will make them get their act together,negative,false
Do NOT stay at this hotel A friend and I booked a 3night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in Chicago Though it was a bit pricy we decided on the Knickerbocker because it was in a great location and the rooms looked large and wellkept Our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time However despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an HOUR until we were allowed up to our room The concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late To top it off the maid service was terrible The only thing they seemed to do was make the bed no vacuuming no fresh towels etc We didnt want to stay the third night but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee This hotel is way too much money for the services they provide youd be better off staying in a Motel 6,negative,false
I went to stay in the Millenium Hotel Chicago Now first being from rural midwest I was surprised at the price in general but kind of accepted it when I was assured by my cousinwhom I was visiting in Chicago said it was normal So I check in service seems fine I get checked in room seems ok A couple of hours later a lady comes into my room not a hotel employee just some lady Turns out they cross checked the rooms Weher and I went down and complained Turns out they double booked the room not that they were full but they were full on THAT room type Standard as well as the Superior Rooms Rather than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to move up We argued with them for 20 minutes they didnt budge our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra 60 for a Corner Superior Wethe lady her name was Sharon decided to split the difference some she gave me 20 and I moved I get to the new room about 20 minutes later nobody but Sharon helped me move I get there the bed was thrown together not made and the bathroom wasnt clean the garbage had a kleenex in itI wasnt going to check if it was used I called down it was now 5PM No answer I called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone I told them about the state of my room They said they would have someone up right away I waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in not in uniform but she did a hell of a job cleaning She switched out the garbage wiped out the whole bathroom vaccuumed around me and switched out the bedding all told she was in and out in 10 minutes She didnt say two words to me but she did clean I stayed the night and checked out a 7AM and will never go back Ryan from Iowa,negative,false
When I walked into the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel my first thought was wow this is very yellow and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse my room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in It was a Victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms i would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms,negative,false
The Millennium Hotel Knickerbocker sounds fine and the website is pretty but the reality is an overhyped overpriced realityisntasgoodasfantasy package The catering they offer is a joke you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the Chicago area While the rooms were cleaner than most there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses and when I called to complain about it a nasalvoiced clerk blew me off The rooms look small but cozy when you book online but when you get there in person you realize just how tiny they are Trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can  did I mention that it smelled like cleaning solution? I also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is In fact it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small youd get better prices and a far better room from the Hilton,negative,false
I chose to stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel during a recent trip to Chicago because I had heard they had good reviews Boy were these reviews wrong I had terrible service from the moment I walked in the doors I was not greeted by the receptionist it was like I wasnt even there My room was NOT ready for me when I got there even though I got there AFTER my required checkin time then once I was allowed to go to my room it was filthy It was as if they didnt even clean it so I dont know what the hold up was There were no towels shampoo or soap in the bathroom The worst part was that there were bugs in the tub The place was the most disgusting place Ive ever been to and it is supposed to be one of the nicest It should be the nicest for the price they charge I do not recommend staying here Stay at your own risk,negative,false
I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago Checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 one front desk agent 30 minutes to process Both guests had issues with their rooms regarding it seemed wrong room types and being out of the room type requested I was nervous about my own reservation and sure enough my Superior Corner room wasnt available The hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available I was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel Want internet? Upcharge Want extra pillows? Upcharge Extra coffee for the room? Upcharge Bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating I wont be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking,negative,false
When we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago we had one of the worst visits i have ever experienced Our room was not ready right away so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby And finally when we made it to our room we found a moldy shower and a dirty floor The room service took about an hours and a half to come to the room and she we went to the pool that day it was so crowded there was no room to sit on the side Our experience was definitely not a pleasant one To make matters even worse we were billed twice for our room which my husband luckily caught before we left I am never coming back to Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel,negative,false
For the amount of money per night that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel charges one would at least expect a room with a working bathroom The toilet wouldnt flush the sink dripped and the towels were rough and cheap looking When I called the front desk to ask for maintenance on the sink and toilet the staff were indifferent It was over an hour before anyone arrived to fix the bathroom fixtures and when they did arrive they were unable to stop the drip in the sink All in all I was disappointed with my stay,negative,false
After a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel The problems started in the parking lot yup before I even got in There was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble Upon first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room The elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out The hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking When in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on This was only the beginning of our terrible stay Guests where in the hall and banging on walls all night long The maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass We could not check out soon enough We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip,negative,false
I had such high hopes when I booked a stay at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago a few short weeks ago When I arrived I should have known things would not be as I expected them to be The host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that I was there When I finally got checked in and arrived in my room I found that the temperature in the room was far too hot The air conditioner was not turned on and on a hot muggy day it would have been nice to enter into a cool room I turned on the air conditioner and after quite some time the room cooled down Since I arrived in the early afternoon I decided to order room service from the Nix Restaurant that is in the hotel I ordered the Gooey Triple Decker Grilled Cheese at 14 I was expecting the best grilled cheese sandwich I had ever eaten When it finally arrived more than an hour later it was cold and the cheese was far from gooey It also comes with a bowl of Tomato Bisque soup which needless to say was also cold For the quality of the food 14 was way too much to pay for this meal After a meeting with clients we stopped by the Martini Bar for drinks The waitress was rude and seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of people she had to serve Needless to say it took forever to get our drinks We heard other patrons grumbling about the amount of time it took for the drinks to arrive as well Finally we got our drinks we all ordered a French Martini We all took a drink and immediately all our mouths puckered it had far too much pineapple juice in it making it very very tart At 14 each you would think it would be made to perfection far from it The evening finally over I went back to my room where I now found the temperature to be too cold due to the air conditioner not turning itself off when it should have After a miserable night I checked out glad to be done with the Knickerbocker Hotel,negative,false
When I arrived at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I was shocked at the poor and dangerous neighborhood it was situated in This was not the Chicago I was hoping forIn addition to that it looked nothing like it did in the pictures on their website The paint was faded and chipped there was a foul odor in the lobby and there was no staff to speak of After we waited for 15 minutes at the front desk someone finally came and said that they did not have a reservation under our name After a long trip Im sure you know how aggravating that was Finally I got a manager that knew how to work the computer properly and he brought up our reservation Once we got to our room it was very small smelled like smoke and the carpet was severely stained with either wine or blood Also as we were walking to the room in the hallway a cockroach walked right across our path like he owned the place To top it off it seemed everyone staying at the hotel was a gangster or a gambler and his lady for the night All we heard was lots of frighteningly loud love making and arguments ensuing that even a television could not mask It was a nightmare Oh yeah and the shower did have any hot water We complained to the desk and they said that it was not there fault and that it would be fixed my next week When we asked for a discount they said that there were no refunds and that we could leave whenever we wanted,negative,false
While the hotel certainly seems to look beautiful the hotel is actually far from it Even booking a room online was rather difficult and i wasnt able to reach a representative upon calling any of the contact numbers In general coming here is a bad decision despite how it looks its a mistake i wont make again and you shouldnt either,negative,false
Superhigh Bill at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago My wife and I decided to take a weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary I told my wife that I would take care of everything I booked the Millennium Knickerbocker because it had a great location it was reasonably priced for a 4 star hotel and had spa features The hotel loby seemed nice enough and the staff seemed fine The problems for us started when we went to our room I have sinus problems so I didnt notice the smell in our room and my wife didnt say anything to me because she wanted to go with the flow and not ruin our weekend We couldnt find the remote for our television and we didnt call down we were trying to be good sports We were both disappointed when we realized that our hotel didnt have a pool or hot tub swimming and relaxing in a hot tub is one of the reasons we go on vacation Upon checking out I was hit was 250 dollar fee for smoking in our room My wife and I dont smoke and there was nothing we could do to get out of the smoking fee If that wasnt bad enough we were hit with a 50 fee for the missing remote control,negative,false
The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel has seen better days I had fond memories of staying there when it was considered the finest hotel I booked a room to celebrate a special occasion and found a highlypriced not so great property I had to look at five suites before I found one where the upholstered furniture was to my liking some of the other rooms carpet was not clean the refrigerator was dripping water and the balcony was littered with cigarette butts I finally settled for a room only because the bellman was friendly and apologetic but as over priced as it was I should have turned around and walked out I sent a letter to the management when I returned home but it had been a month and I never received an answer There are plenty of other places to spend your money Dont leave it at this hotel,negative,false
I had wanted to stay in this hotel since I had heard about how historic it is and I was highly disappointed with my stay there The room that I was given was dirty and when I went back to the front desk to inquire about it they disregarded my concerns It took them a very long time to get me a new room and they whole time they were very unprofessional and did not make me feel welcome I did not stay in the hotel all night since the people in the rooms around mine were unruly and were making noises all night long I left that night but not before demanding a refund,negative,false
Although the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago claims to be an affordable upscale hotel in the heart of Chicago it is somewhat expensive starting at 200 per night There are very few special discount rates available for the budget conscious traveler The rooms are modern looking and a little less cozy than one might prefer The carpeting in the rooms is a little outdated and somewhat dirty in a few areas The views from the rooms are not as great as they could be The hotel seems to be understaffed and the heating unit in the room is hard to adjust to the right temperature Although the hotel is located on Chicagos famous Michigan Avenue it is a 40 taxi ride from OHare airport and a 36 taxi ride from Midway airport both rather pricey options If you chose to drive there the valet parking charge is a hefty 53 Again not very budget friendly All in all even though the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago is close to some of the major Chicago attractions it is only an average hotel on many levels,negative,false
We stayed in the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago in a standard guest room The rooms had just been renovated but the changes did not make much of a difference The room was so small it felt like we were sleeping below deck on a boat The decor was drab and there was nothing special about the room We were excited about the bathrobe and slippers that came with the room but we assumed there would be a bathrobe and a pair of slippers for each of us there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers We called the front desk to ask for a second set and were treated like we were trying to scam the hotel and refused to send them It would not have mattered if they sent a second set the bathrobe was so scratchy it gave me a rash and there were stains on the slippers As hotel guests we expected to be treated with respect and enjoy the stay we paid for We were severely disappointed,negative,false
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is one of the worse hotels I have stayed in Everything from the lobby to the staff to the room experience was horrible As I walked in to the lobby the lobby had a fowl smell similar to rotten eggs The staff wasnt much better especially room service where it took over 30 minutes just to make my request for more towels The baggage handlers gave me rude service and when checking in or out they almost just refuse to provide service The room I stayed in was ill maintained and looked like nothing like in the pictures The windows were dirty and I couldnt see anything outside the window The room smelled like someone soiled the room and there were ants crawling on the tabletops If I had to give any suggestion on this hotel you should just avoid this hotel all together Even a cheap motel has better standards than this hotel,negative,false
This hotel is overpriced One should pay money for luxury but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge When you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain markup because yes they do have to make money But the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me When I got there and went to my room I thought that there would be nice colors a great view and deluxe bedding What I got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of targetthey were not cheap but not that expensive either I think I could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night I paid,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and there is no way Ill be going back Check in took a long time as there many people arriving for a conference and only a single staff member at the reception desk My room itself was barely passable  the bathroom seemed to need a good cleaning and the room itself looked like it had seen better days long before I ever was here For the price I was paying youd think theyd allow access to the work out facilities but they wanted an outrageous PER DAY charge Top it off with the small pool and no hot tub and you wont want to be spending any time here at all To top it off the promised discount rate wasnt honored at the end of my stay despite being assured that all was well at check in I ended up arguing with the manager about it when I was checking out  since I had to catch a flight no resolution happened and as of yet Im still waiting for responses to my calls and letters Chicago has a lot better hotels to offer and for the price per night I paid it wasnt worth it Even the Shulas wasnt enough to make me want to return here,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel It was my first time staying at this hotel and I am sorry to say it was my last time staying there One of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise The walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night I could hear my neighbors in the next room talking Although I could not quite make out the words of their conversations I could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer In addition I was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door presumably on the way to their rooms Admittedly I am a light sleeper but this was ridiculous If you decide to stay here I suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out When I checked mine I found that I was being charged a rate higher than the one that I was supposed to be charged I had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me and the front desk service is woefully slow and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected Finally though I had been told upon checkin that my room had been recently updated I cannot believe that statement was accurate The room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn All in all I round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing Next time I will arrange to stay elsewhere,negative,false
The Sheraton Chicago is not the place to be if you want to experience Chicago There are no customer services to provide you with ideas of what to do and there arent even any shuttles that will bring you around town The food in the restaurant at the Hotel serves mediocre burgers and fries and makes no attempt to emulate the Chicago culture There are a million other hotels in Chicago and this is one of the most average The rooms are fairly decent sized but they lack amenities like wifi and mini bars The view is nothing special and the concierge is anything but responsive to phone calls,negative,false
My husband and I made a reservation at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for a much needed weekend getaway We took off work early Friday to beat traffic Once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking We drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel Upon checking in we were informed that the floor where our room was located was in the process of having the carpets cleaned We decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation We took the elevator which smelled like urine up to our room We did see some carpet cleaning machines unattended in the hallway I hoped for the sake of safety no children were staying on this floor We walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine The overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us We called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms He rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings Just then the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and I could not hear anything else my husband said We decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel It was an awful experience,negative,false
For the price you would think this would be a top quality hotel but it was nowhere close Service at checkin was slow and unfriendly The room was even worse It was small dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though I had requested a nonsmoking room The cover on the bed was stained there was hair all over the bathroom floor and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall Everything looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel I also didnt appreciate having to pay for wifi when other premium hotels offer it for free Overall this was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in a long time and considering the price it was terrible,negative,false
This might be a classy looking hotel in downtown Chicago and while the location is not bad the rooms are definitely hit or miss They range from the super basic affordable room to the presidential and huge suites that only presidents could probably even afford With so many different room options its no wonder they have difficulty honoring your exact reservation if you checkin past 400 pm The hotel has a decent pool but the health club is extra per day as are many other services at the hotel Youd imagine that for the price of a stay here 160 up to multiple hundreds that more things would be included Additionally the checkin staff was a bit snobby and unhelpful I really would expect great service for the high price of a stay here If I were to return to Chicago again Id definitely try out staying somewhere else,negative,false
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers in December of last year and had one of my worst hotel experiences ever First when I went to check in I was completely ignored by the staff they were rude and seemed to have better things to do than help me check in When I got to my room all the way on the 23rd floor the room was dirty and had not been cleaned So back down to the lobby and they seemed to feel it was no big deal and gave me another room I went back to check and the new room was dirty also There were pubic hairs on the bed and in the bathroom It appeared the maid only went into the room and picked up trash and made the bed but did not clean All I can say is YUCK My next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room AGAIN Extremely poor customer service and gross rooms I felt like I was staying at a 30 a night roach motel not the 250 a night Sheraton My advise is to stay away,negative,false
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago hotel for a business meeting and had an absolutely horrible experience When i arrived exhausted after a series of delayed flights I was told that my room was not ready Not ready at 5pm are you kidding me After waiting in the lobby for 30 minutes I was finally called over to the desk only to be told my king room was changed to a room with two queen beds fine whatever I get up to my room and unload all of my bags only to find my ac doesnt work I call down to the desk and the clerk tells me that they are sold out and there is no where to move me but she could discount my rooms 20 No apology Nothing Im exhausted and deal with my 80+ degree room When I went to check out the next morning I find out no one even bothered to apply the discount Again no apology I have never received such poor customer service in my life and will not be comming back,negative,false
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers recently and I was completely dissatisfied When I arrived the clerk was very rude to my guest and myself We finally got all of our things figured out and went to our room There is a river right outside and i constantly heard boats passing by My bathroom was disgusting and not to mention very small I did not have a very pleasant experience at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers,negative,false
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is not the hotel for persons wishing to have a relaxing getaway Upon entering this hotel you have the impressions that it is a warm and inviting place One encounter with the staff will change this point of view immediately the person who assisted us was not very knowledgeable with his duties and did not provide the overall attention required or expected Everything about this hotel exudes class and sophistication Training for the staff should be conducted immediately in order to match classy look of the hotel with their interactions with the customers I am truly diappointed with the fact that my stay at this hotel was as substandarded as it was I was so looking forward to a wonderful stay at your establishment I hope that the issues mentioned earlier are resolved However I do not plan to return to this hotel again,negative,false
I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied I arrived to find that they had lost my reservation They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in He was almost helpful He searched the database and found that there was a cancellation however it was not for the type of room I had reserved I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days I was given a box with a bed in it They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation Unfortunately I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked I had no choice but to accept what they had offered I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here Do not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything even if it was their error,negative,false
Stay away from this hotel A few months back me and my wife decided to get out and have a nice pampered away from home weekend Looking at different options for this weekend we decided to go with the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers They claim  Experience the extraordinary  and this sounded great When we arrived at hotel we were met buy a closed front door and nobody to help with bags The front desk clerk explained that our room was not yet ready and to goto the bar for some complemenatry drinks After waiting 2 hours for our room we finally can start to relax Well upon entering room the smell of something horrible is overwhelming  The front desk informed us there was no other rooms and they would bring up some air freshner We packed our bags and headed over to x hotel and were able to get to our pampered weekend away from home,negative,false
I booked my room at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers somewhat reluctantly I was not enthusiastic about spending over 200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online Unfortunately my hopes were dashed once again when I arrived at my room I say at because after discovering my newly issued key was not working I had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in The room was painfully small if I didnt know better I would have thought I was staying at a Red Roof Inn The sweet sleeper bed had stiff and scratchy sheets with a cheapmotelthin coverlet The disappointment continued after I entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible I stayed my two nights and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room for which I was not responsible charged on demand movies an empty mini bar AND for smoking in the bathroom HAH I have stopped payment on my credit card and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again,negative,false
I was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment It started with check in I had specifically requested a room with a single kingsize bed but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms OK rather rudely that because of some bankers convention that was going on I should be happy with the doublebed room that was left It was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience The room itself was OK nothing special though The cleaning staff mustve just been through because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air The internet jack wasnt working It took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it no apologies given For the price I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton I guess theyre really no better than anyone else these days,negative,false
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice but it certainly does not exceed expectations as touted on their website Their Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler Chic but not fussy is an overstatement The room was clean although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it hadnt been cleaned since the last guest There was hand lotion and shampoo samples but no soap sample The bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed Cheap might have been a better adjective Check out was simple and not much hassle Overall the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch but next time I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room,negative,false
My family and I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers with the belief our stay would be a 5 star experience That was the farthest thing from the truth The staff was very rude and unhelpful The hotel is so large that you will get lost if you dont have the help of the staff Once we did find our room our card would not get us in and we had to start all over So overall it took over an hour just to get us in a room As we entered the room we noticed a foul smell that we just overlooked because we were happy to just finally be able to rest My wife went to the bathroom and to our amazement there was what appeared to be dog hair all over the tub and tile floor That was just the beginning of our bad stay After being in the room for about 30 minutes there was a knock at the door that just happened to be the Chicago police There was a report of the smell of marijuana coming from the room My family was put through a series of embarrasing questions and actually had our luggage and personal belongings searched There was a small amount of marijuana found in the drawer of the dresser that we never touched Come to find out after video surveillance the cleaning lady was arrested for possession of marijuana Needless to say our stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was the worst part of our vacation and I would not recommend anyone to stay at this place,negative,false
I was sorely disappointed with the Sheraton Chicago From the outside it looks like a great hotel and I guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy not what I expected when looked at the website The front desk staff was nice enough at first but when I asked for the wifi password they told me I had to pay extra I mean come on Im paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is EXTRA? The lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation Note to self dont let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow I guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview from some of the rooms and it seems pretty safe Other than that I was not impressed for the price  Ive stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens a better restaurant where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour we stayed two nights and we didnt get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5 I guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell  not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell In general it seems lke its on the decline and the staff knows it theyre just kind of lackadaisical I wouldnt stay there again,negative,false
I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers When we arrived at the hotel the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it After speaking to the onduty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money I for one wont be going back to this hotel,negative,false
We planned a fun time for our kids this summer by booking a kids suite at the Swissotel Chicago Our fun time was not exactly that Upon arriving for our weekend getaway we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite did not mean a thing Apparently there were none of the kids suites available The kids suite is supposed to have things to keep the kids happy when they are in the room coloring video games etc No one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available Whatever So we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available Guess what? We spent the whole weekend in the same room Yes the staff apologized but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it Other than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly the rooms were clean We did not spend a lot of time in the hotel but I will not be booking a room here again The staff did not impress me at all and we did not feel like we were treated well at all,negative,false
While staying at the Swissotel Chicago I experienced some of the worst customer service I have at any hotel The front desk was extremely rude while checking out and even seemed to try to hurry us out The fitness center was always packed and I was never able to get on any of the machines as was the pool area While eating at the restaurant I felt it was a very overpriced meal but it was very elegant looking The last issue I had with the hotel was the valet parking it took them awhile to get my car and they actually pulled the wrong car around It was another 10 minutes while I waited for them to sort the issue out The worst part by far was the customer service and although the hotel looked nice it wasnt worth the stay with the way I felt I was treated based on the money I was spending Next time we are in Chicago we will be staying somewhere else,negative,false
The Swissotel Chicago hotel aspires to be a tourists paradise a hotel so grand and luxurious that youd rather stay than return home at the end of your trip But is it really as magnificent as suggested? True you can get a massage the rooms have flat screen TVs and iPod docks heck theres even a gym But the truth is youre really paying much more for a few things you dont really need The Swissotel attempts to lure you in with their illusions of grandeur when really all youre getting is a Holiday Inn style room with fancy wallpaper and the ability to play tunes from your mp3 player Overpriced dining options are available at the Palm Restaurant They claim to serve excellent lobster yet what I ordered was the size of a craw fish and left the taste of a burnt fifty dollar bill in my mouth This hotel hides behind a velvet curtain hoping their facade wont be revealed,negative,false
Swissotel Chicago Dont let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you This hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect Firstly the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality For example the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off its support after trying to open them for a city view The bedroom bed Kingsized makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make Of coarse this isnt too bad once you fall asleep until then it sucks In regards to room services the hotel workers are not all that friendly They talk to you in a stubborn way as if they just want to get it done and over with just to get their paycheck Yes they do all basic room service orders but it is not all too friendly Overall this hotel has its much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has which is a bare minimum With that being said I would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown Chicago area in need for at least average hotel services However if subpar service and quality is okay for you then this hotel could be suitable however considering its prices you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms,negative,false
I stayed at the Swissotel Chicago while I was on holiday recently and I have to say that you definitely get what you pay for I was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised I was sorely mistaken The first problem I had was when I got there they told me that they had double booked the suite I had reserved They gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room I should have left then but I decided to keep an open mind After we were all settled in my husband and I went to The Palm restaurant My husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times Each time we asked them to fix it they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff After dinner we went back to our room Just sitting on the bed I knew it would be a long night The mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them When I went to the restroom the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons My husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one We just didnt want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in I tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional He pressed really had and hurt my back Perhaps it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session For lunch we tried Geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way I decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later Once I got sick I was done I went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because I was not going to sleep there one more night I made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable After a lot of arguing he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel This was the worst place I had ever stayed I think a Super 8 Motel would have been more luxurious,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Swissotel Chicago with my husband and two children While the room was comfortable I did not think that it was the best choice of hotel for those with children The main reason for this was the dining While the in house restaurants had childrens options there were not any other dining options that were a bit more informal Anyone with children knows that you dont want to take them to a sit down restaurant at certain times This was especially true since we were traveling We arrived at the hotel with tired children in hand and wanted to eat a quick meal and then put them to bed However our only real options on location were these fancy restaurants This was certainly not the most family friendly of options for a hotel with a kid friendly package,negative,false
What I thought was going to be a romantic Chicago Weekend turn out to be lackluster The Swissotel Chicago per their website seem to tout itself as a luxury destination well much to my surprise it was not First my reservation was messed up instead of getting the classic room with a view we were put in what I guess is their classic king The view was nothing to write home about When I called the front desk to complain about the situation I was told their was nothing they could do since the hotel was booked solid I asked how could this happen when I got a confirmation? The clerk simply said probably a glitch sorry is there anything else I can help you with? At the point I hung up the phone as I knew our romantic weekend with a view was not going to happen When we checked out I told a manager what happened and He said there was nothing we can do sorry I expected a little more customer service from them since they think of themselves as a luxury destination,negative,false
Worst high priced hotel Ive ever stayed at I had a business meeting in Chicago and heard good reviews from a few coworkers thought it would be a nice place to stay but was a little upset with my experience with Swissotel in ChicagoFront desk clerk was very rude at check in valet parking was great until they brought my SUV around front with a quarter size dent in the passenger size door the hotel refused to pay for the damages The room was very beautiful besides the faint mildew smell in the room Room service was great and very pleasingOur business meeting took place in the St Gallen room where our meeting took a little disruptive turn there was construction going on during that time and was very hard to hear the announcer in our meeting Other than that the hotel was beautiful but the stay wasnt as great as i expected you may want to book somewhere else if you have a business meeting to attend in Chicago,negative,false
My husband and I stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend It was far from that We could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain the person who answered the phone was extremely rude We were unable to relax at all Also the room was not very clean there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock We will not be returning to this awful place,negative,false
I recently was in Chicago on business and chose to stay at the Swissotel Chicago The hotel sells itself as being stylish sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city I would have been better off anywhere else I was not impressed with the interior finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste I guess stylish might be modern in some peoples minds but not mine Also luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical When I made my way to reception I hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website I had organized an executive suite as I was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room and thought the extra space would come in handy When I proceeded to check in the girl at the desk told me while smacking gum that I had no reservation I handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong even though I had spelled it out for her She then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference all of the executive suites had already been allocated but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room Correct me if I am wrong but this is a step down from the room I had asked for Surely if you give away my room you should try to compensate me with something better I said that no I really needed more space as I would be using the room as an office and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available and that if I wanted to switch the following evening I would be welcome to do that The room was ok although again I was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt I did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services but found them sadly lacking Some comments on the services the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect and also a per day fee which borders on extortion There was free wifi in the lobby but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out I did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived The fitness center and pool which I was looking forward to using were closed for cleaning when I went up Breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items which is not what I would have expected for the money All in all I would say your money is better spent elsewhere,negative,false
I recently had the misfortune of staying at the Swissotel Chicago hotel in Illinois and it was one of the worse travel experiences I have ever had First off the shuttle that was suppose to pick us up at the air port was late by over an hour Then when the bus finally came the driver was nice enough but it was clearly his first day on the job since he got lost going back to the hotel Finally when we got to the hotel they didnt seem to have our reservation for the 2nd room my wife and I stay in one room our teenage girls usually stay in their own room So after the very rude clerk at the corner did nothing to help us we were forced to pack into one room we would have rented another room but they had no vacancies left They hotel did have a large occupancy rate but that only slowed up everything else our room service was late almost everytime we ordered and the hotel restaurant never had a wait less then 45 mins The quality of the room was fair enough but it was almost impossible to get room service we could not get fresh towels for almost 2 days We were suppose to stay for a week we left after 4 days and found a different hotel to stay at I would not recommend this place to anyone stay away,negative,false
I was very disappointed with this hotel I have stayed in other Swissotels and enjoyed them very much but the service can only be described as aloof There was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information I had given her minutes ago Precise indeed Room service took forever to pick up good sign in a way=busy because they are good but the food arrived very late and very cold The man tried to replace it but than took another hour and I was never given a price reduction free dessert or anything to apologize As for cleanliness they must be next to godly as they knocked on my door at 0800 despite the fact I had a doorknocker requesting no service Im a late sleeper Very disappointed with my stay This hotel clearly did not help build the chains reputation,negative,false
I received the type of room that I had reserved Cleanliness seems to be an issue with the maid staff The carpet had debris and the bathroom needed attention Room service was adequate but not great The walls seem to be paper then as I heard one neighbors TV for most of the night and the other neighbors late enjoyment,negative,false
I stayed at Swissotel Chicago for 1 night while on vacation with my girlfriend Our plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate We walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel Once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention she got off the phone and acted like I was the one at fault Needless to say I will not be staying here again,negative,false
Chicago is my favorite city visit I wanted to share this special city with a new love and booked us a room at the Swissotel It is advertised as close to downtown and close to the museums of Chicago I wanted to share my new love It was indeed close to the museums but to get to either the shopping district or the Chicago Art Institute it was a long walk full of detours and it was not easy to grab a cab While the rooms seemed to be luxuriously decorated the beds were uncomfortable and the rooms just were not very clean The Room Service was slow the food arrived cold and the total experience was way so expensive for what we got I do not think I have ever experienced the level of noise in such a grand hotel as the Swissotel seems I would not recommend the Swissotel because disappointment noise and cold food should just not cost that much,negative,false
Grant it this hotel seems very nice but I was not at all pleased with my stay here The customer service was horrible I had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either For as much as I paid to stay here youd think the least youd get is an iron Not I had to request an iron too In addition to all of the failed amenities I was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and wasnt reimbursed until an entire week later The next time I choose to visit Chicago Swissotel will be the last place I think to stay,negative,false
I booked a room at Swissotel Chicago because I thought the price was reasonable and at the base price it was however it ended up costing more than I had planned for as you have to pay for parking and other amenities The service was not very good considering they market themselves as a luxury hotel There was no one there to help us bring in our bags when we had a difficult time doing so and the staff were cold All in all I would say it was an average experience not luxurious like they claim it to be,negative,false
My husband and I arrived at the Swissotel Chicago to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary We automatically thought our experience would be nice because the pictures on the website and the hotels brochure intrigued us Boy were wee wrong Upon arrival at the given and advertised checkin time our room was not ready We waited for more than an hour with our bags in hand We checked more than twice to see if the room was ready but the staff was less than warm both times After a few frowns and mumbles from the people at the desk in the hotels lobby tired and finally arriving to our room we expected to take a nap and hit the city We reserved the premier Corner King or so we thought We were supposed to be able to see the lakes and rivers and the skyline Yeah right All we saw were the brick side of the other side of the building In addition the water in the shower had little pressure We called the front desk the phone rang for 21 times before someone answered My husband said that he thinks that they knew we were the people calling We requested a better room but they said that none was available However they did have an upgraded room but we would have to pay some sort of upgrade fee We could not believe it My husband felt that we should not agitate them any further for fear that they might make things even worse for us like turn off our air We threw on some more jeans and headed fro the coffee shop around the corner that had given us refuge before After returning about 2 hours later the water pressure was fixed The room was clean and the bed was plush but the overall experience especially the rudeness of the staff was not good Lets just say that on our next 13th anniversary we wont stay at the Swissotel and will tell others to not stay there,negative,false
I had really high hopes for this hotel The location seemed great and the prices were too Unfortunatley you get what you pay for Despite being located near the miracle mile and navy pier there werent many other redeeming qualities The staff was very rude We arrived late after a long drive from Detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in Once we finally got checked in our room hadnt been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people We were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they couldnt get to it until morning We had planned on seeing some of Chicagos attractions like the Field Museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go Their website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them Finally when we checked out they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night RIDICULOUS,negative,false
The Swissotel Chicago is a very mediocre hotel the service is always poor and the room service food always comes cold unless its supposed to be cold than it comes warm I would rather stay at a super 8 than this place again,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago with my wife I was on business but I thought Id take her so we could see the city as well Chicago was great The Allegronot so much I mean it looked nice great lobby and all The service wasnt so great though The clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude Like we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend The bell hop took our bags to our room none to gently My wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room Which wasnt that bad till he actually asked for a tip Our room was okay The bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved The next day my wife went out and returned to find our room wasnt cleaned Our trip to the Chicago had its nice moments all outside the hotel The Hotel Allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better I wont stay there again,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago while on a business trip I have to say that I was very displeased with the service i received during my stay Even though their website boasts that their staff will be at your beck and call i found them to be very rude The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the noise level very high I was awakened by guests in the next room several times Even though I complained to the front desk they did not resolve the issue I definitely would not recommend this hotel and I will be staying at a different hotel if I am in the area again,negative,false
I recently visited Chicago I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago First of all I did not enjoy the welcome as i checked in to the hotel My hotel price was off the roof and i only used it to sleep and eat breakfast The food served was not up to par I felt like it was a cheap free lunch My room was crowded and my waste baskets did not have bags in them My toilet paper row was half way finished when I checked in I felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room I did not feel safe I had to hide my valuables and I kept the BUSY sign on the door so no one would enter and take stuff The rooms did not appear as they do on their website it is actually the opposite Looked to me like a regular motel inn but I paid way more than I would have at an actual motel inn I did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone,negative,false
I visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter I booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels I was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation Let me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way I booked the hotel stay for over a week which was very expensive and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well They did nothing to accommodate me and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she didnt know the area To tope it all off the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it Worst hotel experience of my life I will never go back  Sandy D,negative,false
I was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel The overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance Given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level this was most disappointing Nor was I impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff,negative,false
The Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website but to our surprise when we arrived our names were nowhere to be found in their system No room no accommodations at the restaurant nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked and never did they offer us a replacement dining option I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time We will never be staying here again,negative,false
My daughter wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago for her 21st birthday recently and I wanted to find the best hotel for her experience I looked at the hotel website and really like Hotel Allegros insistence in supplying organic fare and inroom spa services so I booked us for a Friday and Saturday night Upon arriving the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant Not enough to warrant a verbal complaint but enough to make my daughter and I feel uneasy After checkin which took at least 20 minutes due to severe understaffing we headed to our room trying to be optimistic Our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound and we only had a stock of 2 towels which were never replaced during our stay We made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel It was a huge disappointment for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl I highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel There are much better choices in the Chicago area,negative,false
I arrived at the hotel 15 minutes prior to check in time as they recommend When I get there I noticed that there is a couple and two other people waiting in line to check in Ten minutes later after standing there with my suitcase the woman at the front desk informs us that their computers are down due to a recent update to the software She told us to wait until the computers booted back up I asked if I could drop my suitcase off at the room and she said no because they need to electronically activate the cards and with the computers down they couldnt activate the cards Finally another 20 minutes later the computers were up and I finally got my room Wheres the luxury in waiting 35 minutes for a room? They also need to change the name of the hotel because their service did not leave me allegro,negative,false
I have been stayed in Allegro for two days There are not other big prolems but one thing Im not satisfied with is the light It is dark in the room Also in the bathroom the light is not good I have to open curtains I have complained about this to their reception They said they will fix it but I did not get any response I am very disappointed and I will never come back again,negative,false
Upon my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar The bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby The front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep that I had previously checked in with told me that there wernt anymore available rooms She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready I didnt have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge  why was I not given that suite after what I just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items If my stay wasnt already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated The meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online I can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant,negative,false
Your website wowed me enough to book online although I had never used your hotel I had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to Chicago and I was VERY disappointed The first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk We had to wait a long time to get checked in When we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom The maid hadnt finished the room and shed left her stuff behind Of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle The next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one We knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled non barking pets This animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep I called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped I think the dog just gave up because it didnt sound like the desk staff knew what to do The crowning disaster at least for my kids and husband was that the remote control for the tv was dead We managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake Your hotel looks great but actually being there is not great I cannot recommend it to anyone,negative,false
My wife and I recently stayed at the Allegro hotel in Chicago and were extremely disappointed It claims to be a luxury hotel but the air conditioning in our unit wasnt working and the ice maker in refridgerator was unbearably slow We phoned in these issues to the front desk and the person on the other end assured us these problems would be taken care of Noone ever showed up Aside from that there were so many kids running around we couldnt think straight This is just my two cents but Id would tell anyone considering staying at the Allegro to pass and look at their other options,negative,false
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago this past summer Needless to say we will not be returning The Hotel is very overpriced for what you get Upon arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had The bed was very uncomfortable and the fullystocked honor bar was stocked with only a few choices The shower did not even workWe booked the King Suite with Jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi I would not recommend this place,negative,false
I was very unsatisfied with my stay at the Allegro The front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window After giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet This came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began After waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested We were informed that they were only requests and not a guarantee Room service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed When we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted The food took an eternity to reach the room and the order wasnt exactly right either This is not the kind of service I expected from an upscale hotel,negative,false
My wife and I were very much looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago We had been looking forward to a romantic getaway I have to say Hotel Allegro was a disappointment for both of us This is a pet friendly hotel  we knew that going in But we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given In the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover Very shocking for the price we were paying When we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by Past this  the room itself  it has flair I guess but I cant imagine it is the right flair for many The colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow designy wallpaper Neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all I cant imagine many would It really was offputting Overall the experience was a check minus in my book Will not be looking to return any time soon,negative,false
My wife and I were guests at the Hotel Allego in Chicago for a long weekend getaway September 2  5 2011 We had checked out the hotels website long before booking and were quite excited about our trip Once we arrived the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy When I asked to be moved to another room my wife has asthma we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time The room was not particularly wellcleaned we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor and a film of dust across the television set We are not the type to complain so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it At nighttime when we tried to sleep we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly We were tossing and turning half the night In the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack The concierge was almost never around in the lobby her sign always said Be right back and when we did ask her questions she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us The second night was without incident luckily except for the terrible bed but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our Do Not Disturb sign I would not recommend this hotel,negative,false
This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere It smells because pets are allowed This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed There was mold in our room and bathroom pet hair everywhere Kids love pools How can they claim to be kid friendly without one? My kid was bored The food was basically the same every day no variation in the menu Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their travel club because our room didnt even remotely resemble the pictures They did the old bait and switch We reserved a family room When we opened the door of our room we realized that it wasnt what the website pictured or had what the website described We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers Definitely do not recommend this hotel,negative,false
While the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside my experience went downhill once I walked in The lighting is very poor which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere The mood was accompanied by lessthanfriendly staff members who made our checkin seem like nothing more than a huge hassle I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay I definitely would not stay here again,negative,false
Since this was our first visit to the windy city we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique We read many great reviews regarding the Kimpton brand so we gave it a go The go ended up being a no go We were sorely disappointed When we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice We have two kids with us so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby We were told no problem Unfortunately it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next Then we noticed a bug or bugs near the fridge area Yikes We called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room or floor Our request was met about 30 minutes later By this time we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions we almost wanted to throw the towel in Customer service was so lacking We wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city but had to wait around for our new room and the crib This is not what we expected at all for this HIGH price Will have to think hard before we book with a Kimpton hotel again,negative,false
This hotel was not at all what I expected it would be The website and its pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in The amenities were not what I was looking for and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area and they were not very prompt when responding to requests I understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service I dont think I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon,negative,false
My recent stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago couldnt have gone worse Apart from the price of staying there and the slow response time of hotel staff I was totally let down by the food that could be found there There are many attractions in the area and indeed leaving the hotel is the best part of the experience,negative,false
The Amalfi Hotel Chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay When arriving at the hotel my party and I had over a 20 minute wait just to check in We were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their private counter that their website highlights It felt as though I was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in Not only did the wait and process take seemingly forever but our reservations were completely wrong I ended up having to settle for a double nonsmoking room when I had reserved a smoking king room Not having the room I requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel I was not compensated for having to switch rooms and Audrey our Experience Designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze I recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is a waste of time and money as far as I am concerned especially when I could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort Dont waist your time staying here,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago Although I visit this fun city quite often I was somewhat disappointed with the service and noise in a hotel that is called luxury boutique To begin with our Experience Designer was somewhat putoffish and cool She did not really have a grasp of all the wonderful things to do in Chicago Although she did look up some attractions it seems like she may have recently arrived from LA As far as the room it was indeed luxury and had nice lighting and decoration However the noise from the adjoining room was unbelievable and kept us up all night Most likely the walls are very thin and construction is not the greatest Who wants to hear the neighbors especially when they are honeymooners or whatever So we probably will not stay there again The location is great the cocktails fine the luxury is there but other than that it is the pits Weary Traveler San Francisco,negative,false
First stepping foot on the hotel propety I could tell it was a negative place Seeing as how there was what apperd to me to be Vice Lords all aroung the property Not that i have a personal problem or affelated with another gang Its just the way they was acting drinking the hotels cheepest wine they could of been there for securaty purpouses like the hells angels was to some concerts Walking in the hotel i oder hit me It smelled like a cretan type of burning wood that i have smelled only later to find out it was the smell of rock cocine I looked at the pool only to find there was no watter and scateborders all around the place Me being a high class bizness man I decided to leave,negative,false
The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago advertises itself as family friendly yet when I arrived with my children it was anything BUT family friendly The staff seemed miffed and stuck up and I had to wait for the personal check in I was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited and other guests all single or couples without children seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in This might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two even though it is advertised as such I give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising Amalfi,negative,false
The Amalfi Hotel advertises itself as a luxury boutique hotel and as such I expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average Unfortunately this was not the case The room I booked was not clean in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest There was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned In addition although the room was supposed to be a nonsmoking room I could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke I will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants sites and shops all within walking distance However given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room I would not stay at the Amalfi Hotel again,negative,false
I recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago Sure it looks nice but its really just a smoke screen I went to the clerk to check in and she was VERY rude to me I was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that I need to go find a phone book and ask someone else She also encoded my key wrong so I had to have it redone I finaly get to my room only to discover it was a mess The sheets were thrown on the floor the curtains were wide open and to top it all off the toliet hadnt been flushed It was horrible I called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up but I was told they were on break Whatever thoguh I cleaned up myself The night progresses and I awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door Some guy said that I was in HIS room It baffled me but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up They had given his the wrong room I couldnt take one more day of all the bull I checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to Chicago I would NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE,negative,false
This hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here The Amalfi Hotel Chicago advertises itself as a luxury hotel located in downtown Chicago Since it is in downtown Chicago that means that I had street noises keeping me up most of the night My view also suffered They had nicer rooms available with better views but the markups to stay in them was outrageous The room itself was decent with clean linens and nice air conditioning but I can get that in just about any hotel these days There wasnt anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a standout for me but for the price I paid for the room I certainly had that expectation It was a let down,negative,false
Dont let the website fool you I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago on my last business trip and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel Ive ever stayed at The website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but its more on par with a 2 stars or 3 if you want to be generous First off the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture The room that I checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls and the carpet looked like it hadnt been vacuumed since god knows when Since I was only staying one night I decided not to ask for a different room although I dont know if asking for a different room wouldve made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk When I arrived there were two receptionists chatting it up no acknowledgement no prompt service I had to wait about 3 minutes although I was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me And no they werent talking about hotel matters Im not a difficult or an especially picky person and who doesnt chat during work with their coworkers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism Do yourself a favor and go stay at the Marriott if you want service unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for,negative,false
i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in Chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning the girl at the front desk was busy talking to a one of her friends and when i finally did get her to wait on me she was rude and seemed bothered to have to wait on me the room wasnt at all what i was expecting it was dingy dirty and just seems like an old hotel just not what i was looking for in a nice hotel seemed like the quality youd expect from a cheap motel,negative,false
The service was only subpar and then rooms needed better cleaning I was at the check in counter longer than expected because they decided to use a trainee to check me in definitely no fun after such a long flight There were no clean towels in the room and my bill was returned with room service charges of which I did not order,negative,false
As a former Chicagoan Im appalled at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago First of all I was expecting luxury and hospitality neither of which I received Theres an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a personal concierge but my experience with my ED was terrible I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to Not only that but I couldnt understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast When I finally got to my room I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the rooms cleanliness I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp On top of that the bed was messily done I could have done a better job on my own bed at home I was angry at this point because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi and I didnt expect to be greeted with wet towels I needed to use the WiFi to download some important documents and the internet was surprisingly slow Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better maybe even faster internet access When I finally checked out of the Amalfi I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems Id had with my room and the hotel I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away,negative,false
I had the misfortune of being booked at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago a few weeks ago What a joke To start off the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed I dont know who made the bed up in my room but it could have been done better by my 7 year old Ditto the bathroom Water spots soap scum and ugh hair of ALL kinds in the sink tub and about the floor GROSS I requested nonsmoking either they didnt listen or didnt care but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray The beautiful view was ruined by water spots  not outsidewhich is forgiveable but INSIDE And they were sticky I stayed only one night The Holiday Inn had rooms available and they were clean Never Again,negative,false
Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is one of the worst hotels Ive ever stayed at I travel a lot for my job and it just so happened that this was the hotel the company was paying for Four star hotel? Yeah right I wish I could give it negative stars I dont even know where to begin Normally with these reviews I try to outline the aspects that stood out but its just so overwhelmingly bad Anyhow here it goes To begin with the customer service stank You think youve seen rude service people before? Well this is customer service stuff of nightmares I had a reservation but I still had to wait for 30 minutes yes I counted for someone just to pay attention to me When she did finally she was chewing gum No visible uniform or name tag Clearly didnt want to be here She took one glance at my reservation didnt enter anything into the computer at all and told me that they couldnt accept it because the date had already passed WHAT? The date for the reservation I had written down was *that day* I was furious After a 20 minute shouting match and an equally incompetent manager that left me so angry I could scream they finally grudgingly accepted my name and reservation into the computer so that I could book my room Then there was the room itself On first glance it appeared clean but a closer inspection revealed black mold on the bathroom ceiling a sink tap that gushed rustylooking *brown* water a minibar which was picked at the remnants looking like they had been there for several years and a mattress with a mysteriously disgusting yellow stain on it The pillowcases also looked yellowed but I couldnt decide if I was beginning to see things I was already so upset with the place After an extremely sleepless night of paper walls and neighbors who were apparently elephants I can easily say that I would NEVER go back to that hotel again Ever Not if somebody payed me,negative,false
I needed to find a last minute hotel to stay in for the night so i came to this one First of all the prices for one night are extremely high The workers at the front desk were not kind at all and treated me like i was a second rate and not on their list of priorities Then i got into my room and got settled and it smelled of cigarettes and the air conditioner was making loud sounds so i didnt get much sleep Also the restroom was very dirty and frankly disgusting The beds were very old and uncomfortable and the tv did not work at all Overall i am very disappointed with this hotel,negative,false
My experience at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was not very pleasant When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by our Experience Designer who was not the friendliest of people Also me and my husband tossed and turned all night on their very uncomfortable bed For the price I would have expected a more luxurious experience,negative,false
When my husband and I went to Amalfi Hotel we were expecting first class service First when we got there we learned they had given our room to another guest and we were not able to get a suite like we had booked Room service took forever and the food was subpar Supposedly they had planners to help explore the area but we requested one and never saw hide nor hair of a planner The spa staff seemed incompetent The only positive things I can say about Amalfi Hotel was that the rooms were stylish as advertised I give this hotel two stars,negative,false
I was highly disappointed with my choice to stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago I had to travel for business at the last minute but felt lucky to get a reservation at such a highly rated hotel The initial impression was that the desk clerk thought I was lucky that he was waiting on me I had several questions about local attractions and he acted as though I was bothering him I was the only customer in the lobby and he directed me to a rack of brochures located near the concierge then went back to leaning against the counter On the plus side the room was lovely but when I called for room service at 930pm I was told they were closed even though the menu said they served until 10pm I decided to go out rather than fight the issue The next day the tone was the same at the pool the bar the restaurant etc The staff here seems to have a general feeling that the guests are lucky enough to stay in such a chic hotel and they are more like part of the atmosphere instead of actual employees with a job to do The only exception was the housekeeping staff I called them for extra pillows and another blanket and they were at my door in 10 minutes and made to ask if there was anything else I needed before leaving The bottom line is that I booked my room here with the intention to relax for a day or two after my business was completed but decided against it Even though the hotel was beautiful and in a nice location the atmosphere was not inviting Id rather go somewhere where I felt like my money was appreciated instead of staying somewhere that didnt seem to care that I was there,negative,false
The Amalfi Hotel has a beautiful website and interior decorating but thats about it When my wife and I got here we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned The Internet access promised on the hotels website was down so I couldnt catch up on any of the business I had intended to do and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic like she was sleeping inside a Salvador Dali painting All in all this hotel was not worth the money especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the citysomething more casual and comfortable would have been better and it would probably have been cleaner too,negative,false
My wife and I decided to stay at the Amalfi while we visited friends in Chicago we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this Luxury hotel to any of our friends Amalfi claims that your stay begins with a warm greeting but we received the exact opposite The front desk clerk was rude sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room Apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog who we had to bring at the last minute The room on the Pet Floor was alright nothing spectacular and unfortunately had a slight scent of coveredup dog urine We proceeded to dinner at Keefers Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time I have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant The next day I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly and had to finish some work at our friends house My wife had called for some extra towels and pillows which took about half an hour to receive She also ordered breakfast because Breakfast in Bed WAS her favorite until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them We were set to stay for 3 days but only managed to stay 2 We will not be staying here again,negative,false
I was genuinely surprised by my stay at this hotel The walls were paper thin and I could hear conversations in the next room This is not something I would have expected from a higher class of hotel The room was also smaller than I would have expected for the price We were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning We requested new towels but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request The checkin process was frustrating mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter I dont know if she was having a bad day or just happens to be in such a mood all the time but either way it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with Overall not a pleasant experience I think next time well choose another hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago,negative,false
We will not be back to this hotel There are several reasons for this but it began at checkin when the staff were very rude and uptight Our reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it The room was OK but the beds were hard and uncomfortable The room next door had their TV turned up very loudly and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option They didnt offer any other solutions The food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests Overall we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago,negative,false
The Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile The outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city For the cost of the rooms starting at 17900 a night you would think they would have a competent parking attendant I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room and if that was not enough To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations,negative,false
I have to agree that the InterContinental Chicago is a nice hotel from the outside But it is not a nice place to stay if you are planning to visit Chicago The ambience of the hotel looks bland and they also have the same amenities as other cheaper hotels You can get an excellent dining experience somewhere for less,negative,false
I stayed at the InterContinental in Chicago for my visit to set up my Daughters wedding Nina Our Daughter stated this was the place where all the higher echilon gets hitched Well I dont understand why at all Upon arrival we checked in and met Nina at the The Bar how innovative and had a light supper The food was like airline food and cold The waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet When he finally came with the check we thought our light supper was all too pricey Then we were supposed to meet the sales manager Erin in the Lobby at 800 PM sharp Not sharp enough At 815 a worker came over to us and stated that Erin had an emergency and wouldnt be able to meet with us tonight Well that is just great Over 300 for a night and supper that would obviously be wasted No more money will be spent here I will Guarentee that Sincerely Mr and Mrs Scott Grander Louisville KY,negative,false
The Intercontinental Chicago was not as great an experience as I was expecting it to be When I first arrived the front desk staff could not find my reservation in the system They then tried to make me book a higher paying room I ended up having to ask for the manager who conveniently was able to locate a room for me with the same rate I was expecting top notch service and class but apparently those services are reserved for the elite I was not doted on as I should have been and found that I had long wait times when I placed an order with room service or needed the concierge For the price I was paying to stay there I would have thought there would have been more of a catered and personal touch to the service,negative,false
I was on a business trip to Chicago a while back and I had the unfortunate luck of staying at the InterContinental Chicago Hotel I say unfortunate  because from the first moment I walked in my experience was poor The front desk made me wait a very long time and I had to resolve an issue with my reservation My receptionist had made the reservation and the room should have already been on or company account but they were insisting that I supply a personal credit card for the room I understand their precautions but I travel a lot and usually do not encounter this situation Once that was all taken care of several phone calls later I was taken up to my room It was nice and I was glad to finally be there but the bell hope was very short with me and was very quick to throw out his hand asking for a tip even though he had done nothing but groaned the entire time he was taking me to my room I was very happy I only had to stay there two night because after my run in with the front desk I got the impression that no one wanted to deal with me I will hopefully not be staying there again and will suggest that it be avoided by all,negative,false
I recently had a horrible stay at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago When I first arrived I was impressed with the architecture and location but things went downhill in a hurry The front desk staff was extremely rude upon checking in and even though I had reserved a room with two queen beds they told me that only king bed rooms were available at the time and there was nothing they could do about it The room itself was a nightmare It smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement There was also a huge problem with my television in that it would automatically turn itself off every 15 minutes or so I complained about these problems but very little was done The hotel staff eventually did bring me new sheets but the quality was only marginally improved Overall I was very disappointed with my stay at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago From the pictures I had seen online I had expected a wonderful hotel but what I actually got was on par with what you would typically find at a rundown interstate motel,negative,false
This hotel has a good name and a good location in Chicago Unfortunately I was very unsatisfied with this hotel This is a luxury hotel so you are paying luxury prices So I expect to get my moneys worth Unfortunately that was not the case at the InterContinental Firstly my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture Again this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and its expensive I shouldnt be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty I also had trouble getting the room to the temperature I wanted Im not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if its a problem in the whole hotel The building is old and I suppose it has a lot of problems from being old Secondly I was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotels staff I thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive Thirdly this hotel has a lot of additional expenses I felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got use of the fitness amenities internet etc When Im already paying so much for a hotel room I get very irritated when I feel Im being nickelanddimed every chance they get This hotel has a nice looking building and again its in a terrific location But I really dont think its worth the expense There are so many other hotels in Chicago to choose from that are so much better,negative,false
Ive never written a review before but I just had to share my experience with Chicagos InterContinental Hotel I booked a weekend at this hotel for my wifes birthday Weve never stayed at a luxury hotel before and I thought this would be a great experience for us The horrors started when we first got to the counter The clerk mixed up our rooms and when I pointed this out he got really snooty with me We get to our room and the maid hadnt cleaned it yet We had to wait around for that so we went to the hotels restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced Finally our room is finished and the the view we were promised was nonexistent To top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning The toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain A stain on the sheets What a waste of money I pointed this out the concierge and we werent even offered a refund or discount Never again,negative,false
This hotel was very poor with customer service They were so worried about keeping everything up to date and perfect looking in the hotel they rarely worried about their customers and their guests I had to ask for my room to be serviced for cleaning and it took a long time to get a response Very disappointed,negative,false
My husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend of Sept 1718 2011 When we were planning our vacation we were impressed with the hotel The exterior is very lovely and we looked forward to enjoying the view from our room We first started to wonder if wed made the right choice when there was no one waiting to help us with our bags We had to carry our luggage up to our room ourselves as the hotel was in the middle of a shift change This seems like something a supposedly world class hotel should be able to avoid The good Our room did have a nice view and when I sat down on the bed it was like sitting on a cloud The shower was very pleasant The bad The room was very small and the bed was not the King size we had requested We felt very cramped and uncomfortable throughout our stay We have stayed at less luxurious hotels that were much more spacious and able to provide us with the requested size bed The restaurant options were acceptable although the service was not as excellent as described Perhaps we expected a miracle that wouldve changed our minds about the hotel We were so disappointed by the room and the service at checkin the rest of the weekend was somewhat tainted We usually enjoy partaking of room service but we decided after a sub par first day we would eat out for the rest of the weekend Next time we will look into other hotels in the Chicago area,negative,false
The InterContinental Chicago hotel terrible First of all the continental breakfast was a joke The food was unhealthy and unsatisfactory After our first night we expected the maid to come clean up our room We came back from siteseeing to find that our room was in the same condition we left it in I will never go back to this hotel again,negative,false
The International Chicago Magnificent Mile is shrouded in glamour but underneath the facade fades away The classical architectural landmark should be translated to old and boring I found this hotel via Google and have regretted it ever since Room size was small and unaccommodating and that was one of the newer rooms Everything was free except for the gym why that wouldnt be free with the price I paid I dont know This hotel is overpriced for the quality and size of the room that you get and I would not recommend staying there,negative,false
My family and I were in Chicago for a friends wedding We had asked around to find a hotel that was nice but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel The hotel appeared very nice and to have all the amenities Room service WiFi clean rooms Unfortunately as it turned out appearances can be deceiving It begins at the desk where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring He said they didnt have any rooms available because we didnt make arrangements It was getting late and we had no place to go there werent any hotels nearby and my kids were starving I asked if there was anything he could do and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night Apparently our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard because this room wasnt even clean and the wifi didnt work We ordered room service and it never came even after several complaints It doesnt end there either when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service Overall this was a very frustrating experience and I wouldnt stay there again,negative,false
My wife and I were excited to visit and shop at Chicagos Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave We chose the Intercontinental Hotel for its reputation and location Man oh man were we disappointed The check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well We got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains There were six people in line for her and we had to wait That was no problem since we werent on a timetable When we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the Miracle Mile she just pointed to the door and said Its right out the door I asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying theres no such thing I couldnt believe her abruptness We left the concierge stand not wanting to return Shopping went well and was fun We returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge We couldnt find a hotel directory in the room I called the Housekeeping Department and was told were all out of directories here in the office I asked if they could check a vacant room for one She said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms I hung up and thought I would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages Guess what? You guessed it no phone book in the room I figured we could go get a drink at The Bar the hotels 20s themed lounge and ask the bartender for suggestions We went to The Bar and there were only three other customers We sat at the bar and got our drinks As I was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions his cell phone rang He answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk Twenty minutes later he was still on the phone Tired and hungry my wife and I went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from Pizza Hut Although the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back A big thumbs down to the Intercontinental Chicago They need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary,negative,false
Problems started when I booked the InterContinental Chicago online at the hotels site and got a server error Somehow I managed to get my reservation and wish I had looked elsewhere on this great Chicago street filled with plenty of other options The server errors continued at check in and didnt let up I was on a holiday weekend but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers and I had trouble getting served The hotel is enormous and doesnt give a sense of comfort The health facilities are also just too big so noisy and crowded And Internet access was 18 a day kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks Next time Ill pick a more intimate place nearbywithout so many server errors,negative,false
Although the InterContinental Chicago Hotel is located on The Magnificent Mile our entire experience as guests there was anything but believe me the magnificence ends at the hotel entrance From checkin to checkout our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific First there was an error with our reservation and once we got to our room we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked so down I trudged to the registration deskwhere I had to wait in line for at least twenty minutesto ask for help The first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to TV noise coming from the next room we werent sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls Then dog tired the next morningeven though we had hung a Do Not Disturb sign on our door handlein barged the maid all brighteyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand Following that rude awakening I was jarred again by a bloodcurdling shriek from my wife who upon entering the bathroom to take her shower was greeted by an incredibly large roach Breakfastactually all meals of which we partook at the hotelwere served cold and were somewhat tasteless We were routinely ignored by the concierge who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him Trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in Of course there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart Getting out of the InterContinental Chicago was believe me the best part of our experience as guests there,negative,false
Recently stayed at the InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile and was a little underwhelmed Its convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating There is a definite need for some noise control  everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room Hearing the plumbing from other guests rooms was particularly annoying The fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use at least it wasnt included with my booking choice Parking was pretty expensive so if you really dont need it dont use it Overall just dissappointed that the great location wasnt matched with great accommodations,negative,false
I only stayed here for five days but I will definitely never be going back The architecture is kind of cool but the customer service was very poor I dont know how much these people get paid but they must not think it is enough Breakfast at the The Continental was alright but it was overpriced This hotel felt really crowded and the service was impersonal There are many better places to stay in Chicago,negative,false
This hotel is ok but is not the best for the money First of all the parking prices are exorbitant I know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high Also the service at this hotel was poor I felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general and the staff at The Palmer House seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us In addition I feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet Also the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you I would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about The Palmer House,negative,false
A decent place to stay The people are nice enough yet the atmosphere was not what I was expecting The rooms were not very spacious nor welcoming So many places to eat yet the food was very pricey and average I would stay here again possibly but I feel like I could find a better option for a better price,negative,false
When I first made reservations at The Palmer House Hilton I was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website Little did I know it was going to be a total disaster First off my husband and I couldnt find the place It was our first time in Chicago after all And when I would call for directions they just kept putting me on hold When my husband and I finally arrived the bus boy was extremely rude After manhandling our luggage he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip Talk about arrogant The front desk clerk was a little too pushy My husband and I were only staying one night just to attend my sisters wedding but they kept trying to upsell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room The room itself was okay decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that youre worth They even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the snack bar and ordered a movie that Ive never even heard of Completely unprofessional I will never I repeat NEVER stay at this hotel ever again,negative,false
I had an awful experience here The staff were rude and unhelpful It took forever to check in and when I did they took a while to even find my reservation When I got to the room it was marginally clean and when I complained they said they were full and could not do anything for me I would never go back They are obviously not worried about customer service,negative,false
I would not stay at this hotel again The rooms had a fowl odor It seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned The neighborhood was also less than desirable The housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms I will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted,negative,false
My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was less than satisfactory I would have expected much for from such a high end hotel The rooms were way over priced and the service was less than satisfactory At one point I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up and when room service came through they were still there On the other side of things the cup I had left on my desk which I was planning to use later was gone My coffee and my towels were also never replaced I also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room Rather it was a nominal fee After paying so much for a room I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi My stay at the Palmer House Hilton left much to be wished for I will not be staying there again,negative,false
Oh My More Like A Dank Museum Than A Four Star Hotel I read so many reviews on this hotel that I was sure my husband and I wouldnt be disappointed on spending our 10th Wedding Anniversary in the heart of Chicago at such a luxurious hotel All the reviews sounded great so I feel awkward writing this but I have to be fair  this place was a major disappointment While the location is superb the images online must have been taken over 10 years ago because all of the decor when we visited looked very old and faded I noticed dirt everywhere  the fabric on the furniture was stained the baseboards and woodwork were scratched and dirty and there seemed to be a smell of mold and mildew that permeated the entire hotel Even though the food was great the linens glassware and silverware were not sparkling  it sort of helped that candles were lit so I didnt focus too much on how dreary and washed out the dining facility was I didnt realize experiencing history would actually mean staying at a hotel thats living in the past This was barely a two star hotel and I do not recommend staying here at all,negative,false
I recently stayed at the Palmer House Hilton on a business trip to Chicago I will do my best to make sure that future employees of my company do I have to stay here When the reservation was made an early checkin was arranged  due to travel arrangements my travel companion and I were to get to the city in the early hours of the morning We had arranged an early checkin without having to pay for the night before There was no fuss raised when we agreed on this and so we assumed it would be fine When we got there however there were no rooms available for us for hours and they refused to keep our bags We were forced to change clothes and wash up in the public restrooms of the office building where our first meeting took place and cart our bags around with us They offered insincere apologies and didnt offer to comp us anything for the inconvenience The rest of the stay one night was nothing to praise I guess not having bugs would count as positive? I would definitely never recommend that anyone stay here,negative,false
The Chicago Palmer House disappointed me I chose it because it a Hilton hotel but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name My first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff My room might have been luxurious years ago but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening The bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible The food served by the room service and at the hotels restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine The food simply did not deliver its promises Everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small The location of the hotel might seem like an advantage since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions however the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by Overall this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range,negative,false
The Hilton family would be outraged after hearing about a recent stay ie nightmare at the Palmer House Hilton I arrived 3 days before the National Restaurant Association tade show hoping to beat the crowds and settle in for a long week of trade show business When I arrived I was greeted or really snarled at by the Clerk This lady if one can really call this beast that was aggressive and rude from the get go She made a snide comment on the number of bags I had and it was downhill from there My guaranteed and confirmed reservation had been mysteriously cancelled and she indicated that I had been the one to contact their call center seeking a cancellation I informed Brenda that I had never cancelled my reservation We had originally booked 2 rooms one for me and one for colleague and my colleague changed their reservation to come in one day later She huffed and puffed and finally said oh okay I read it wrong but we dont have a room for you My room had been given away to someone else that had arrived earlier that day As a Hilton Honors member and someone that drops lots of money on this chain I was furious She said that perhaps someone else had found me a room at another hotel and to wait while she checked She left the front desk and was gone for almost 20 minutes coming back with a smirk on her face She informed me that I had to make a decision and that both would not be satisfactory 100% The first option was to stay at a hotel outside of the Chicago downtown closer to the airport or that I could go with another room they had a smaller smoking one with the potential but promise of an upgrade in 3 or 4 days I was outraged No Im sorry and certainly the options were horrible I ended up taking the smoking room where I barely spent any time in it due to the strong cigarette smells Additionally there was no upgrade at all during my stay there I was not offered anything to make up for my troubles their screwup nor did the hotel manager bother to return my call The net outcome I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and Im thinking of shredding my Hilton Honors card Dont make the mistake of dealing with this property You will be very very sorry Thanks for reading all this Hopefully it will help someone out there before booking at this joke of a hotel,negative,false
Having traveled to Chicago on business once before I was looking forward to spending some vacation time in the city and wanted to have the best accommodations for my trip After some research I decided that the Palmer House Hilton sounded like the perfect place to stay And in a way it was perfect  perfectly awful After reading some positive reviews and checking out the hotels website I was expecting a luxury room that was a notch above the ordinary However my standard guest room which the hotels website describes as deluxe was very bland and generic and reminded me of rooms I had stayed in at budget chain hotels not pricier historic hotels such as this one The carpeting looked dingy so I had to wear shoes or slippers any time I walked on it and there was a gap in the curtains that made it impossible to block out the sunlight in the morning  or the horrendous view of a brick wall that I had from my window In addition the sink in the bathroom dripped constantly and was an annoyance all night long Everything cost extra including the gym the pool and the spa and the restaurant prices were outrageous This hotel is overpriced overrated and definitely subpar I wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy,negative,false
My husband three year old son and I arrived at the Palmer House Hilton last Friday for a weekend stay The hotel looked elegant online but included information that also indicated it was child friendly At the check in the staff was cold and seemed quite annoyed by son who was merely saying hi and asking the name of the person helping us One elevator was broken we had a long wait for other elevator The hallway appeared a bit dirty as we made our way to our room The room was decent Not deluxe as their website indicated it would be but is was comfortable and the view was good We had a long day of sight seeing and play on Saturday As my son was tired we elected to return to our room and have room service for dinner There was no childrens menu for room service Only for the restaurant from which the room service came from the same kitchen what??? We ordered an adult meal The food arrived an hour later cold and unappealing But we at it because we couldnt wait another hour Although the hotel looks lovely The service was not very good Most of the staff was cold and snooty Except for the cleaning staff who were very nice It might be ok for a couple or business traveler but do not stay with children A comfortable motel might be better,negative,false
Upon entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom After placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet I immediately called room service and asked for a new room They apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess After oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door She seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it After the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip I hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room I thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod Yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor And nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air When I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own If I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa After giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed Egyptian sheets? Right All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour If you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel,negative,false
The pictures on this website sure are deceiving In real life the Palmer House Hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning Now granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip It wasnt They charged us for a minibar fee when we dont even drink no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway They also did not get our wakeup calls to us on time so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip We had to spend 50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way wed planned And then it wasnt as good because the tour guide wasnt there and we got lost My husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one It was terrible I certainly wont be staying here again,negative,false
Although the Architecture of the hotel is quaint that is about the only positive of this terible hotel The guest services were unhelpful at best and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful And as for the rooms small cramped and it seemed as if the sheets hadnt been cleaned in the last 5 years My stay here was distasteful and I never intend to return except to ask for my money back,negative,false
Overall the hotel was okay Though I did have a problem with the price The accommodations mentioned on the website were accurate other than the supposedly luxury mattress it was not more comfortable than my own mattress but this hotel offers nothing more than a much more affordable hotel There is a difference between the Palmer House Hilton lobby and your normal affordable lobby But I do not go to a hotel because it has a fancy lobby I go to get a good nights sleep When I want to sight see I go elsewhere Like I said overall the hotel was okay but it was not worth the price,negative,false
I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there,negative,false
Our visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and instead of helping a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us They had trouble locating our reservation Our room was tiny When Im paying over 400 a night for a room I expect to be able to walk around in it The beds were also tiny The walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door This hotel was probably once beautiful and classy but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs Wont be staying here again,negative,false
Though grand and having a brand this hotel seems to disappoint me on certain fronts 1 Staff seemed snooty and arrogant 2 Request for upgrade was fulfilled only after repetitive requestsThe initial room was very small 3 for the cost paid I would expect a coffee maker free internet service at the least which even regular BBs offer 4They will levy charges on each and everythingComplete rip off Other things matched the GrandeurCleanliness and location was good but the staff made my stay unpleasant,negative,false
The Palmer House Hilton while it looks good in pictures and the outside is actually a disaster of a hotel When I went through the lobby was dirty my room hadnt been cleaned and smelled thoroughly of smoke When I requested more pillows the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said shed send them up It took over an hour for 2 pillows This hotel is a good example that what you pay for isnt always what you get I will not be returning,negative,false
My 200 Gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the 16th I filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them This was such a disappointment as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in Chicago Our room was really nice with 2 bathrooms We had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed We had a great view of the lake and park The hotel charged us 25 to check in early 10am,negative,true
This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby However when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty Wireless internet is available but thats an additional fee Are you kidding? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free Also the fitness room was available for only 15 per day Wow I thought the room rate was enough to cover that When I used the coffee supplies in the room they were not replenished I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasnt housekeepings area but they would send some up No kidding nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar Glad I wasnt in a big hurry Ill definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time Im in Chicago,negative,true
The hotel is very impressive upon entering and the staff was very friendly however we felt our room was very dated and worn looking Our air conditioning didnt seem to be working well but we turned it down and thought that it would eventually cool off Our first night was interrupted by a phone call at one AM That was a fax it happened 4 times By this time we realized that the air was not working again so after fussing with the controls it did kick on The next morning I mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone but didnt think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working After being out seeing the sites of Chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to resting in a cool room before going to a show  Our room was 78 degrees I called and maintenience did come to check After determining that the unit needed a motor it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out I feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel Also was very surprised that WiFi was not a free service  We will not be staying at the Hilton on our next trip to Chicago,negative,true
Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services First of all from reading other reviews now I know I got ripped @ 249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for 79 albiet I got free wifi The hotel is nice but it can only get so nice for an oldieno matter how much money you dump into it Shower head was really low Im 61 water pressure was low It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by check out reviews on Yelp For some off reason I ended up with two double beds they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone If traveling here 1  make sure you get a better deal than I did 2  confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3  Dont have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor nor was it a good fit for the romantic coupleit wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers sp? trying to save money,negative,true
I checked into this hotel Rm 1760 on 11132010 Next day I woke up with bed bug bites numerous on my arm and back We reported this to the management who assiged us to rm 1901 and promised to get the room inspected and taken care of I insisted that they get all my clothes laundered which they did Interestingly no one from the management other than the security guy who came when we first complained even offered any apology for the inconvience I missed couple of meetings that day The next day I called as I forgot something in the previous room only to discover that the room was already assigned to the next guest So much for reporting,negative,true
I expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment Housekeeping and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesnt go down past 74 the closet is 24 wide all olddirty brass fixtures beds that are a little bigger than a twin showerheads that barely put out water then this is your hotel I might be spoiled by staying in Marriotts but I stay in hotels 13 of the year and was severly disappionted No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again,negative,true
I stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was host to a conference I was attending Before I arrived I tried to find out about the In Room Fitness program advertised on the corporate website I called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center I explained that I was inquiring about the In Room Fitness advertised on their website She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly I did and got the same response I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room Again this was a problem When I arrived at the hotel no treadmill was available When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge 13 per day to use the fitness equipment The pool track and locker room are free but to use the treadmills etc you have to pay 13 per day This charge is not noted anywhere  not on the website not in any of the guest service materials in the room The food for the conference was mediocre but the one room service meal I had was pretty good During one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldnt hear the speaker The HVAC didnt work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay The beds were comfortable with very nice linens I tried to get a late checkout which was offered on a card in my room The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour not the 112pm range advertised in my room The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I couldnt carry it out of the hotel I visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the Marriott properties Only wish I had done so for this visit,negative,true
I stayed there on October 6 2012 When I pulled the covers of my bed there was a small dark brown insect the size of a grain of rice which was either a bed bug or cockroach I trapped it under a glass see the attached pictures and called the front desk The housecleaning person claimed it was a cockroach Absolutely horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem failing to follow through on promises they made to me Setting aside the bug problem I caution that the windows are quite thin We could hear a lot of the street noise which made for a hard nights sleep not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms For 400 a night after tax I strongly encourage you to check for alternatives,negative,true
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed The highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage Finally my 72 year old mother 8 year old son and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves  no easy task The security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me The valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us As far as I could tell he was just standing there doing nothing I couldnt let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking receipt The attendant pointed to where our car was parked  no short distance away My 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up They should have been ashamed Less significant but irritating issues The pool is part of the Hilton Athletic club Two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim Basically two adults can take up 23rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 13rd This is ridiculous and very family unfriendly In addition the pool closes at 9 pm What pool closes at 9? We stayed for 3 nights Not one single additional bar of soap bottle of shampoo or coffee stirrers,negative,true
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago because I was attending a conference at the hotel The room was sufficient  had a coffee maker bed hangers tv etc Thats about where my compliments end *restaurant rates are outrageous 21 for a breakfast buffet? 25 to use the gym? 750hr for WiFi?? This is unacceptable when Im paying 249 per night Thank goodness the ice was free *servers in the restaurant and bar were surly not wellversed in English and just rude *computer monitors in rooms are silly and turn on at random times during the night *conference was incredibly coldeverybody was wearing their overcoats the entire time despite our complaints to management *fridge in room was not usable had to store cold items in the ice bucket *Cable channels just flat out SUCKED I was soooo bored when I had to spend an hour in my room If Im paying that much at least provide the full 70 channels,negative,true
Elegant lobby comfy beds nice sheets but we were given a not fancy a little dated room on the 5th floor which had a view of the monstrous venting structure and was located off the lobby so we heard the elevator all night At the Hilton one is charged for Internet access on each device per hour We stayed in the middle of Ohio and received total access for free We didnt drink the 600 water or try the 28 Breakfast buffet The staff was friendly but of course you tip for a smile They did give us a cot for free as we had asked for a room with a foldout couch as we were a party of 5 Didnt use the gym or pool on the 8th floor but looked nice small pool No view of the water possible though we were right at Grant Park We tried to view the fireworks from a higher story no such luck read more,negative,true
Months prior to my 5night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light facing an open view not a close building The reservation was made through a conference travel agency I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at checkin the clerk noted it in my record She told me it would be difficult to find but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers tucked into a very dark corner facing a wall of rooms I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request but to sit tight and someone would call me No one did Further calls yielded similar results At one point I was told I could have a parlor room with a sofa bed at a reduced rate but I could not go see the room before committing to moving Thats real hospitality for you Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms Other than that it was tight quarters with a tiny closet two uncomfortably low chairs at the desk and in a dark corner Light fixtures didnt do much to brighten things up Since I was here at a conference I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for midday calls and email but instead I got a cave Consequently I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago conference or not I will absolutely stay at another hotel There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of inside tower rooms places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service Shame on the Chicago Hilton,negative,true
I recently stayed here for the Chicago triathlon This was my third stay at this hotel I have not had any issues until this visit After the 3rd day of my stay I requested my room to be serviced and returned to what I thought was a clean room While getting out of bed I was cut by a piece of glass in the carpet I must not have been the first person to be cut in the room because I found dried blood on the bathroom floor afterwards I had not noticed it before so I was very disgusted We notified the staff and asked that the room be vacuumed and the bathroom mopped We returned to the room after 5pm to find that the dried blood was still on the floor After making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no reply from the hotel Considering the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably Luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago,negative,true
Our nonsmoking room smelled very badly of stale cigarette smoke We were not allowed to change rooms Also the concierge staff was unprofessional telling long winded personal stories to uninterested guests while long lines formed The location was great Hotel is dated but would still be a nice place to stay if it werent for customer service issues,negative,true
I stay in Chicago all the time on business and had my first stay at the Chicago Hilton I pretty much only stay at Hilton properties and have stayed at tons from Hawaii all the way to Budapest This Hilton is not up to par Its clean and the front desk staff is nice but in Chicago The Drake Doubletree Guest Suites and even the Hilton Garden Inn are all superior to the Chicago Hilton and less expensive Compared to other Hilton properties in Chicago the rooms were not as well appointed the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice the TV was tiny the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long and the breakfast you get was more like a Hampton Inn than a 4 star hotel If youre going to Chicago and you like Hilton brand hotels you can do far better than this place,negative,true
My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights beat up and old dorm style It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely All night there are chimes that make noise that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying There is no wifi  no matter what they tell you I paid for the wifi and still we were unable to get on Lastly my sister and I split the bill I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit Room cost with city taxes etc was 31369 a night I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper So while the View was wonderful it is NOT worth the money,negative,true
When I called to edit my existing reservation I was placed on hold for 30 minutes Finally someone came on the phone and said Ill have to transfer you so I was put on hold for another 5 minutes When I finally did get to speak to someone as I was going through my changes I asked her to send me a revised copy of the reservation to which she huffed and acted very put off Before she was able to disconnect with me I said I have one more question to which she replied Im working at the front desk and I have customers waiting I thought so am I not your customer? pathetic and rude Hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay,negative,true
Visiting during a busy 2day conference in Chicago Most hotels booked solid The full hotel allows you to meet a wide array of customers Everyone is complaining about service cleanliness and overall experience Location is good Hotel is tired Employees surly Too many cool properties to choose from in this town will never stay here again and will rethink Hilton in general,negative,true
Its not a bad hotel Its just sodisappointing As a Diamond member I expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view Im not distraught over this but come on Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge which has nothing but fattening pastries bagels and cereal Lowlevel Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame And whats with the lounge not opening until 630am? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 630 not sitting down to their meager breakfast The inroom wifi is a pain to access and I somehow got stuck with the 1999 plan even though I selected the basic plan Dont get me started on how a 89night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a fullservice Hilton  Towers seemingly cant Finally whats with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? Its an unseemly waste of space especially when the rooms are so meager And the goldplated bathroom fixtures scream 1992 not 2009 as does the picturetube TV vs flat panel Overall this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed,negative,true
Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting The hotel has some elegance in the lobby meeting rooms and lounges  the hotel rooms could definitely use updating I would definitely say that for the price of a room here  the rooms should be top notch My car was misplaced during valet parking our reservations were messed up hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items room service a new coffee pot laundry that wasnt ours I would not stay at this property again There are much better places for the money in close proximity to Michigan Ave It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at Faulty Towers,negative,true
My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff They sent engineers three times to repair the unit and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasnt under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty At my parents request the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room Dont book this hotel in the summer And by the way there is no view at all from any of the rooms  except for the windows of other buildings,negative,true
We ate at the Prime House restaurant last year that is why we picked the hotel Last year the food and service at the Prime House was outstanding This year the service felt rushed The waitress even asked why we were eating so early It was 630pm Our room in the hotel felt cramped The beds were comfortable The bathroom had maintenance problems The maid service and turndown out night was good All of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful I just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying,negative,true
Just returned from the James Hotel after staying at the Park Hyatt I have stayed at most Chicago Hotels Pennisula Four Seasons The Ritz Fairmont etc Had heard a little about the James and the Primehouse at the James We paid MORE for the room at the James then at any of the above mentioned hotels What a disappoitment The room we stayed in had 2 double beds The toilet broke and overflowed the tub didnt drain while showering and the HUGE bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times The closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all The room was very small and non descript Much like staying at an IKEA but without the color Windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small The staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly The room had a huge 52 plasma TV that was nice There is NO way this hotel is 4 star yet The room rate close to 50000 a night was WAY of of line We paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels The rate should have been about half of that,negative,true
I recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby While the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers When we arrived it took over an hour to check in We had requested two rooms on the same floor which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival When we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it Eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there We also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers When we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in We also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping We filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests After complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate This something never arrived We will not be making a return visit to this hotel While the housekeeping staff location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative,negative,true
Very disapointed in the service and quality of this hotel I travel quite frequently to chicago and have never had this happen at any other 4 star hotel I reserved a king bed At checkin I was informed they were out of kings and basically offered no type of compensation or upgrade When i arrived at the room the air conditioner door was open and rattled all night The TV did not work Had to call for service The following day returned from work at 6pm and found the room had not even been serviced Stay somewhere else,negative,true
Me My sister and my best friend all went to stay here in the summer of 2004they said there all spacious suitesyeah rightour room you could barely walk inand they said theres 2 double bedsyeah well one was a pull out couchand the bathroomtiny tiny tinyand it took forever and a day to check in and the people blamed us for throwing a book out the window and somehow someone knew exactly where it fell from and which roomyeahi wouldnt stay here again,negative,true
I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite No desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table  and canted forward Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos I have to assume this design flaw with the couchfuton runs throughout the property Bed was fine and bath was fine but I cant imagine why business travelers would rate this property well The couchfuton seating is the worst Ive encountered in a modern hotel,negative,true
This hotel does not belong in the same league as The Peninsula Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel Staff was very nice and attentive but the lobby is cramped and only two small elevators for 17 floors Several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor and we were forced to take the stairs The hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews,negative,true
I havent actually stayed at this hotel yet but am already disappointed in their customer service I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotels Cyber Monday Special The promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website the hotel will match that amount in James Credits that can be used toward your stay None of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits My next trip to Chicago is in April so I thought Id give The James a try I travel frequently with my pet and Ive heard they have a very liberal petpolicy So today I went online and bought a 500 certificate Me having the one track mind that I do somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31 2010 I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament I said I couldnt be in Chicago until April Im overseas on business until then and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month or it not refund my gift certificate purchase I had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadnt even recieved my email confirmation yet Most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period The girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me basically saying too bad its your problem now She didnt even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel or try Hotel Monaco I hear they have great service and are good with pets too,negative,true
This hotel was not worth it From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out the staff were rude and contemptuous Rooms were only serviceable and certainly did not live up to the pompous selfdescriptions on the website The bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient The fitness centre was tiny and poor We would not come here again,negative,true
We had a reservation for 3 rooms with 5 adults and 2 kids got only 2 rooms on arrival 2 of the corner rooms with an extra room During the night it was very cold and we were not able to change the ac even though we switched it off it went on cooling strange At night it was very loud from the street In the morning they uploaded something infront of our window and I stood vertically in the bed not what you need if you only spend 1 night in a hotel We came here a few years ago and had it better in mind The area is in good walking distance to all famous shopping places very good Clean and fancy Sorry but next time we`ll be looking for a more quiet hotel in Chicago,negative,true
In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer it sucks if your air conditioner does not work After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room I requested a room change and a not so polite unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity Maybe a manager could help me in the morning The next day went by and no call was received At 7pm I called the front desk No one was aware of my problem Approximately 45 minutes later a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available I accepted it was glee Anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer I was paritally correct The bathroom door of the new room did not close Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the shy part of the relationship As for room 1618 I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner Whats unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room And did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna This hotel need a major overhaul,negative,true
We stayed at the James hotel for a 40th birthday The location was excellent for shopping and restaurants but also very loud The room was horrible VERY SMALL We had a doubledouble and it was the size of a college dorm room plus completely white walls and linens Absolutely no color except for one accent pillow It was very sterile and uninviting We were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting It looked like the entrance to hell if not a haunted house Staff was very nice and accomodating I would not return to this hotel,negative,true
While the James was once considered an elegant chic establishment it has lost its luster The small rooms are filled with cheap Ikea type furnishings Our tiny bathroom flooded with water that escaped the shower curtain Showers and flushings from neighboring rooms sounded more like protective levies collapsing The 2 small elevators could not handle the guests and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended periods of time The thin windows could not contain street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night It was rather provocative to listen to the couple next door carousing but also rather tacky  unsettling It took more then 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out This hotel has lost it and the James sysndicate will have a difficult time competing in New Yorks Soho when they try to open in September New Yorkers will not tolerate shabby incompetence,negative,true
I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel I had requested a high floor quiet room Neither request was honored The windows are not well insulated because the traffic car horns and sirens continued all night long On the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway The safe in our room did not work Someone had locked it before our arrival One of the pictures under the tv had been removed leaving a screw sticking out of the wall The lights are so dim that is next to impossible to read A small alcove with a stained bench had a reading light that was about 50 watts Our room key cards didnt work so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them Upon returning to our room they didnt work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff The bathroom is small and has no fan so the steam covers the mirrors and unless you leave the bathroom door open it does not clear On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room What about a second guest Are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie??? On Sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call We had not requested to be woken up The concierge did not know the way to get to OHare by train and gave us a longer route than was necessary I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicagoquieter and more spacious more elegant and worth the money This is definitely not worth 400 a month By the way I live in Washington DC and am used to city noise This was unacceptable,negative,true
First several day s prior to my stay I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for roomservice Saturday and Sunday Saturday they didnt bring breakfast  and when I called roomservice they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge When they finally did bring it  they brought the wrong thing and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday I was further inconvenienced by inroom dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night The food was limp and uninspired Further I ordered soup  which arrived without a spoon When I called inroom dining to request a spoon I was told one would be forthcoming 15 minutes later a waiter arrived with a menu When I explained I already had food and I didnt need a menu  I needed a spoon he had the audacity to argue with me I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so Another 15 minutes and one bowl of cold soup later I decided to call inroom dining back to request again they send someone with a spoon They too argued with me and expressed that theyd already sent someone with a spoon I explained that they had not  that I had received a menu I didnt request but that no spoon was forthcoming Another 15 minutes later a spoon finally arrived Thanks  for charging me 100+ so that I could argue over cold flavorless food In addition to the gross customer service surly attitude and sorry food I found the room woefully lacking It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell Further I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went,negative,true
I have stayed at the James a few times it is my go to hotel in Chicago This last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options The Good Location is awesome just off Michigan Ave Trader Joes across street for some healthier snacking It is a great location easy to walk most anywhere The door staff are very friendly and helpful The overall feeling is modern upbeat Turn down service with cookie is nice Free Wifi which worked to varying degrees throughout stay The Bad They claim to be a 45 star hotel which to me means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star without a pool They used to have Kiehls toiletries and now have Harmony brand Additionally they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you It is what I would expect from Holiday Inn or my gym but not a 45 star hotel I asked about the switch mainly because when I booked they still had Kiehls in website description and they claimed that the reason they went the communal bottle route was to be green That is hard to believe as its not like the hotel is making other efforts to be green they still have incandescent light bulbs housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down they dont recycle in room etc They are obviously trying to cut costs and it shows More the rooms are in need of some updating they are looking somewhat tired My third floor room was quite loud with the motorcyclers trying to prove their manhood out front not their fault Dont take the stairs as the stairwell is straight out of horror movie even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be awhile The phone staff was fairly rude granted they didnt like me questioning their toiletry change I feel bad giving such a low rating but it really did not come close to my expectations from previous stays there I will start trying out new hotels in the area,negative,true
My inlaws booked a one night stay for New Years Eve for the two of us to stay at the James To be brief there were a few things wrong with our stay which will prevent us from returning and advising our friends not to stay there 1 Shoddy construction of room fixtures ceiling light was missing leaving a fistsized hole with wires exposed BOTH towel racks fell off the wall without being touched and bathroom door often came off its sliding mechanism with gentle use 2 When we reported these problems employees simply put the towel racks back on the wall without properly adhering them to the wall 3 Upon checkout they did not have record of my inlaws paying for our stay though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us We had to pay for our 300 gift and the inlaws were extremely upset When we wrote a letter to management as a manager was not available to speak with us when we left we did not receive an adequate apology,negative,true
The hotel definitely doesnt match its 45 rating The receptionist was very unhelpful and dishonest and I dont feel welcome at all I booked a nonsmoking room but upon arrival the receptionist told me that there was no nonsmoking room left Of course he was lying I argued with him for 5 minutes before he reluctantly gave me a nonsmoking room At checkout they tried to charge me 40 upgrade fee each day because I requested a nonsmoking room This was completely ridiculous I had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges The room was quite small the TV was broken so I had to call someone to fix the TV Then the wireless network banned my IP address so I had to talk to their techsupport  the tech support was quite friendly knowledgeable and helpful  I guess this was the only bright point of the stay,negative,true
My husband and I were there for a conference and had booked the room thru their website when called to confirm had us down for only 1 night instead of 4 easily changed First morning coldcold shower didnt complainnext day fine Phone did not work called every day to complain and every day said it would be fixed when got back to room never was No dial tone unable to call restaurant or call for car or call for room service Finally on last night someone came to our room while we were there and did fix it The hotel is beautiful rooms great and everyone was so nice even when I was complaining they were nice Great gym area also and love the restaurant BUT for the money I could easily find another hotel just as nice with a working phone,negative,true
I stayed at the hotel during the Dave Matthews Caravan tour and would come home each night rather dustydirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200000 of my closest friends I used half a bottle of shampoo the first night The second night the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo I informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately I got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap hand soap for the bathshower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place nicely displayed but with the EXACT SAME bottle of shampoo that was now 18 full Yeah The hotel is in a great location to Navy Pier and Michigan AveIll grant them thatbut thats where their pros end Id rather stay at a Hampton Inn I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,negative,true
While overall a decent property the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights checking out on Monday March 19th Shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasnt present upon checking in We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay I called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One their valet company who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival and was scraped upon departure from the garage The garage manager Mike Yunan didnt call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel Marco Scherer When he finally got back to me the garage manager stated that he would file an incident report and claim with his insurance company Travelers which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldnt admit fault or liability nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage which could have verified that the damage wasnt present upon checkin but was at checkout Their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location contradicting the garage manager In the end this Kimpton InTouch guest got stuck with a 1000 bill for parking at this Kimpton property an almost 500 paint scrape on top of a 48per day parking fee rental car expenses several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue and one gigantic headache In the end do NOT trust the valets or staff at this hotel and take your business elsewhere if at all possible,negative,true
My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews For some reason I kept being disappointed at every turn Noisy room on the 4th floor Could not get the room to cool down  it was stifling BE WARNED  No water no minibar no vending machine no nothing once you get in your room You might as well be in prison They have coffee in the morning but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days I guess that is convenient for them but what about me? Workout facility  pretty small but not the smallest The only treadmill I could get on was broken Guess what a cooler with water in it Oh no  it was only stocked for one day After that nothing Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver Same with towels  one day they have them  next day they dont They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous 10 charge for wireless go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach I have stayed at much better for less Wont be coming back,negative,true
I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is probably the worst service that Ive ever experienced The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting was close to the theater and had what seemed to be a good rate What a huge mistake The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful The room was not clean the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving they never bothered to come turn down the beds and the late checkout priviledges which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became upon request  boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful Dont waste your time or your money here At best its nothing special Personally I like the Fairmont in Chicago but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco,negative,true
We got a spanking deal at this hotel for 99 a night Its in a good location to the Loop Excellent transportation options abound My gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a crappy room It overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us The toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor Other than that if I needed to stay in the Loop again for something and I knew I wasnt going to be put in a undesirable room I would stay here again,negative,true
We stayed at Hotel Monaco and upgraded to a suite I was disappointed with the room layout and shabby furniture I bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground The make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work the TV reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the 450 we spent there Next time we will go back to Trump Tower across the street which is far superior to Hotel Monaco,negative,true
First let me say the front office people at Hotel Monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what Id hoped There are some other problems the furnishings are quite rundown and housekeeping wasnt very helpful We booked a suite and the sofa bed chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use Ive attached pictures so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows Comfortable it was not The chair bottom is all broken down too I invited one of the Assistant Managers to view our furniture and a slight adjustment was made in our rate As to housekeeping we had ordered an inroom coffee service which Kimptons web site says is there but you have to specifically request and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee We had to call the front desk every day And housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl I had requested water be added to the bowl when I noticed it going down and my note was disregarded These things may not matter to you but if you plan to spend a week like we did you might want to be comfortable The bedroom and bathroom were superior just the living room was bad,negative,true
Overhyped and overpriced The fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel The hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadnt been cleanedwell ever The decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed The decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on I couldnt sleep the whole week that I stayed there It was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny my final say is that it is an over priced Holiday Inn,negative,true
Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco We have stayed many times elsewhere primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service beverages like water or soda at the wine bar coffee and papers in the morning help with bags Not only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things the staff was not helpful either Requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there YOu got the feeling you were bothering people if you asked a question No bellman the doorman did not open the door or help with bags Even though we were traveling with a child I had to request a fish when they did not bring it Really baffling as we love the Monoco in Washington,negative,true
I reserved the Rock star suite for my boyfriends birthday months and months in advanced When we arrived at the Hotel Monaco they told us that they doubled booked the room This was after many emails to the hotel inquiring about the room and if it was available They tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant  which we didnt even use I felt we were taken advantage of because we were young The doorman didnt make us feel any better when he told us that it wasnt the first time they did this for the rock star suite However the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake I ordered If it wasnt for the room confusion  It would have been a wonderful stay,negative,true
The service was reasonably wellthey seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily The location was fine being that it was central to the city but I found out that it was also a tremendous drawback It was interesting that the survey I took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response Quiet My visit was anything but mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor facing the street I awoke at 4 am and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window Not the most conducive for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting At checkout when I informed the hotel clerk of my dissatisfation he chuckled and said  Ah city noise,negative,true
We enjoyed the Hotel Monaco Great location for walking and beautiful rooms The staff was so friendly and we especially enjoyed the wine reception and getting to meet other guests Will definitely stay there again,negative,true

I am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before I fall asleep The front desk staff were brief and one of them was chatting with her friend gossiping as I checked in VERY unprofessional The room she offered me was on a high floor 5th HA and when I checked in there was a big bag of grapes left behind by the previous guest on the window sill and some of the previous guests hair in the bathtubI was DONE Called down and had them reclean the room they made no offer to compensate or upgradenot even a bottle of wine The front desk clerk suggested I come down and get a key to another room like I have time for that Disappointing as I do like Kimpton hotels and am a Kimpton In Touch member btw theyve done away with the amenitiesyou just get a free item from the mini bar,negative,true
Excellent Hotel  Rooms and service were great A great value  I have been to places that are not as good for nearly twice the price Good location Close to the L and short walk to rental car service Restaurants in the area a bit of a disappointment but the shopping was great Area recommendations Great theatre restaurants museums and shopping,negative,true
My wife and I brought our daughter downtown for a blowout American Girl Weekend and chose the Monaco because of its glowing reviews We arrived late and maybe thats when they put out their secondstringers but we felt unwelcome by the desk stafflike we were an intrusion Ill never understand thistheyre in the hospitality business and theyre inhospitable This is getting picky but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance The repeated HM initials are peeling offlooks like they used rubdowns where they should have silk screened for durability When we got to our room we found the maids ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed yuck Im still trying to figure out that scenario There were no ashesso Ive ruled out spontaneous combustion Also to the disappointment of my daughter the muchadvertised goldfish was MIA The bellhop who apologized for the shoes explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed is that OK? he said I think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35C fish to make a tired 5yearold happy On the up side the rooms are nice and have an overthetop decoration that my daughter loved Id like to live here she said The bed is VERY comfortablemy wife wants the same brand now The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong showerexcept for the cheap fallapartwhileyoureusingit toilet paper Come on Kimpton How much can a decent roll cost? The view towards the river is great try to get one and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the windowshe closed the curtains and was in her own club house watching the world go by from from high above the city In short very nice hoteldesk staff at night could be nicer wouldnt cost anything and would have made up for the maids shoes,negative,true
This was a refreshing change from the ordinary I loved the location the service and the amenities offered by this hotel The room was charming with a window seat and a water view The decor was unique but cheerful Free wireless internet services were a plus here The staff was helpful and attentive We loved having goldfish share our room I would definitely stay here again,negative,true
If you love Brick Walls and Alleyways then this view is for you I asked for a room facing the river I get a room facing a Brick Wall That really pissed me off From all the great reviews I was expecting better Before I came here I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC and that was awesome There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away The wine hour was ok I was hoping there would be something better food but I guess thats why its a wine hour I ordered room service one night There wasnt really anywhere to eat it so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv This was my first time coming to Chicago and I think it will be my last Just thoroughly disappointed,negative,true
Dont stay here if you take peace in knowing you have a reservation About 3 months ago we booked a room here for our wedding night which is in less than 2 weeks My fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel  no upgrades no discounts Apparently it is my problem that their manager cant manage the convention schedule I dont even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I dont find their reservation system reliable Unfortunately due to the conference there isnt any other place to stay,negative,true
Very centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day Adventist Church my room looked down upon Wacker Drive the aforementioned church and the Chicago River Small room virtually no storage space Attended a conference with the Monaco as venue They provided adequate service with no problems This was the first time I spent with a Kimpton Hotel and I registered for their Frequent Stay program I never felt comfortable in this hotel Im 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age Rude front deskperson of unidentifiable gender The young people can have at it Ill stay at the Marriott Michigan Ave next time,negative,true
This hotel is totally overrated Yes the location is awesome but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options The customer service or lack thereof was particularly disappointing Why are they paying anywhere from 2  8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? Even when her hands are full The housekeeping staff couldnt figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip every day Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you dont bring it anyway As stated previously the location is great Location however does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff I would not stay here again,negative,true
i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror They admitted it was their fault and now they wont pay the 500 to fix it because we cant prove it was not broken before the hotel is wonderful the rooms are new and nice but we will never stay here again because of thisBe sure to inspect your car before you leave,negative,true
I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel It seems as though I had the same experience as Judy L I read her review and thought thats exactly what happened to me Heres what happened The good news The actual event was great Most notably the food was absolutely incredible I think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food The same goes for the cake which was made by Take the Cake The service by the waiters and other staff was also very good The bad news Michelle the Director of Catering honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare While we were negotiating the contract she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls after the contract was signed it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered to schedule the tasting etc She frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time I assumed things would get better within the monthor even the weekprior to my wedding but they actually got even worse Michelle just could not get it together and if it werent for my wedding coordinators assistance in forcing her to finally get things right I dont know what would have happened Thus if it werent for Michelles inability to do her job I would have had a great experience But as it is when I think back about my experience with the Sofitel I unfortunately have very negative thoughts And thats incredibly disappointing considering it was a major part of the best night of my life,negative,true
I disliked the Sofitel so much we changed our week stay to the Grand Hyatt after the first night We checked into our suite and was blasted by the smell of body odor immediately We were tired from our flight but went downstairs to change rooms The second suite smelled just as bad but stayed anyway I disliked the hotel lobby the staff the decorating and especially the bed HORRIBLE Soft flimsy mattress We come to Chicago frequently We have always stayed at the Grand Hyatt and never been disappointed We just thought wed try some place new Never again Back to the Hyatt or Four Season we go,negative,true
I was surprised by the fact that there were no extra sheets or blankets to make up the hide a bed I called the desk and asked for some and they said that I couldnt have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed My husband was ill and I wanted the bed set up so I wouldnt disturb him but they were un moved and wouldnt bring the sheets I ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket They could have given me a set of sheets and a blanket I didnt pay that much a night to sleep on a bare mattress Seriously Lack of concern for the customer,negative,true
The hotel is in a good location It is very contemporary in decoration Beautiful flowers in lobby The room service was very good Concierge services were also very good We were treated well The shower water pressure was very poor Also at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they mailed it to us which we were charged for the 3rd night when our room was actually prepaid It was courteously taken care of after contacting hotel Bar was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for appetizersfood read more,negative,true
A lovely hotel in a trendy part of Chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels The rooms are very very well appointed but not large and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception Unfortunately the service was below average in every way they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline valets didnt deliver the car and had to be asked twice the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue It amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours And even after recognizing their shortcomings not one sincere or significant apology A poster child of how bad service cannot overcome a wellbuilt wellfurnished hotel,negative,true
I would not recommend this hotel Although it is in a good area the room was very small and is getting rather dated The room had extensive damage The paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling The wood work in the bathroom looked like it had been chewed on There was mold and stains on the bathroom tile The room was very small There was not room for a sofa Just a small faded chair and ottoman The carpet had stains on it Also the bed was comfortable but there was not a top sheet just the bottom sheet and a comforter Overall I was not satisfied with the hotel for the price that was charged I have stayed in other hotels in the area that provided much more space cleanliness and value for the money paid,negative,true
I have never experienced terrible service like this especially at such a highly rated hotel I had booked the hotel room for my parents for their anniversary weekend and stopped by earlier in the week to have the charge for the room put on my card as a gift When my parents arrived they were told that the front desk staff was new and did not complete the charge correctly My parents then had to charge their own anniversary trip Additionally my father had requested a nonsmoking room to stay in and was reassured 3 times that his room was nonsmoking When my parents got to the room it reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches on the desk tabletop When my father caled down to the front desk to ask about this the guy at the front desk asked if my dad wanted him to come up and remove the ashtray and matches  something that would clearly not resolve the fact that they were put in a smoking room after being reassured 3 times that the room was nonsmoking NEVER AGAIN,negative,true
I stayed in this hotel during a business trip and while conducting a business meeting in the hotel bar a customer grabbed all of the cash out of my wallet Security was informed but I was told that I had to wait to talk to them After about twenty minutes of waiting I was informed that if I did not continue to wait l would never be able to report the incident despite the fact that I was a hotel guest Unfortunately I had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait Long story short I no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone anyone would have talked to me about it Ive since been on the phone with a manager who promised to call me back once she researched the incident and have yet to hear back despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago I expected more from this hotel,negative,true
October 3rd 2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007 The hotel is VERY modern The room was immaculate but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA It was chipped in many places The light switches were difficult to find and the HVAC made noise However the bed was wonderful The bathroom was large and well maintained Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted The restaurant was small You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel However after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full When we checked in we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals Upon returning home we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it This reduced the line of credit and it took several days to be removed from the card Great location Reasonable value If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon,negative,true
Attended a wedding in Chicago Sofitel is new humming very very modern W hotel style  minimalist and a great location However I miss the basics of a less trendy hotel We checked in at 7 PM and our room wasnt ready  when they gave me a key the maid was still in the room making it up for me I had to wait in the hallway  On the weekend I came back for a nap at about 330 PM after vacating the room at 830 AM and it still wasnt made up The housekeeping line was never answered so had to call front desk to get someone to make up my room Also called housekeeping for a new hairdryer and they never brought me oneI gave upThis is a hot youth hotel but for my next visit I think Id prefer some of the classic amenities likely timely housekeeping a somewhat larger room that you can walk around and a less trendy hot loud clientele Im over 40,negative,true
I never write these reviews but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the #1 2008 travelers choice Terrible Service Lazy Doormenbellmenconciergevalet Lack of Respect allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints Phantom charges to room front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son and the doorman watched on doing nothing Me and my girlfriend are young look young in how we dress but in all honesty make more money than mostand we were treated like cheap poor kids I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up the concierge exclaimed that You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr Blank? Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star 200person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young? Very Dissapointed Very nice looking comfortable beds great room service contemporary younger crowd but service was terrible,negative,true
After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day I left the hotel crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same After doing so I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle As the cab slowed to pick me up the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction When the cab stopped I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman After locking the door the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a jerk before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination Consequently unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen please dont attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman Lastly as for the rest of my stay you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English While I have nothing against the French or French language I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world Viva la USA,negative,true
We stayed at the Ritz Carlton two weeks prior and in comparison the Sofitel does not come close With the deal the Ritz Carlton is putting on right now stay two nightsget one free choose the nicer option Pros Room Service Quick 15 minutes tops Bathroom Large bathroom with a separate shower and tub Lobby Very impressive and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and hailing a cab for you Location Close to the train station and MI Ave Cons NO TOP SHEET We asked the others at the conference they confirmedthere is no top sheet You just sleep with the duvet cover over you Room Small and not a fan of the modern decor Broken closet door the bottom track was bent By the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so I could get to my things Barely any storage closet was teeny tiny anyways almost no bigger than a tall locker only the top drawers of the nightstands open Shower Horrible water pressure The cleaning staff did not replace shampoo soap etc Had to call the front desk and they delivered within 10 mins The cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there realized this as I still noticed a stain we made the first night I made sure not to leave the save the water card out They changed our towels but not the bedding??? Our room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff enter and you could heard that door slam shut all hours of the day They charge for WiFi You can change the settings on the tvbrightness etc,negative,true
We stayed here because of the enthusiastic positive reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp We might have had a one in a million experience but we  were served a hairy salad a long black hair held a lettuce leaf hostage  considered our guest room tiny  could not submerge a thigh much less a body in the tub were not obese and were not Dexter  endured a broken air conditioner for days it couldnt be repaired  experienced the delight of an inexplicably broken toilet they fixed it that day On a positive note the tea from room service tasted delicious employees were abundant and friendly the location is great and its very easy to get a taxi In the future I would reluctantly stay here for business I would not stay here for pleasure I think a 20something who hasnt traveled much would appreciate this hotel more than a seasoned traveler wouldas a friend said to me today Oh the Sofitel? Thats the Hilton of France I agree,negative,true
Didnt get the room we were promised Kind of room we had reserved 2 queens wasnt available they then squeezed 3 adult ladies into 2 singles and a blowup bed Had to pile furniture on top of tables to get it in Very unsatisfactory Will not return will not recommend Will tell people going to Chicago to NOT stay in your hotel When I next visit Paris nextspring I intend to stop at your world headquarters to tell them what I think of the Chicago facility,negative,true
After reading the Trip Advisor reviews I was expecting an exceptional stay I was not impressed overall The concierge the view and the hotel resturant were the highlights The bed although not horrible was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person I was traveling for business and although not dressed in formalwear was also not dressed down but all in all it felt a bit pretentious to me There are better options for the money and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place Sheraton Towers or Trump for the similar price and better stay I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratingsnot #1 in Chicago in my book,negative,true
I was looking for a fun contemporary hotel and it didnt deliver The lobby was nice and the rooms were mostly clean but it really wasnt special Service time was slow for room requests I found empty water bottles under the chair and the a,negative,true
The location is ideal They have very high ceilings so the rooms appear much larger than they are The views are great There were fresh flowers in the bathroom They had all white bedding You feel like a princess there,negative,true
We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end Bad cheap furniture carpet that stops short of reaching the wall a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew BAD BAD experience Find aother hotel plenty in the area,negative,true
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel Good location but the room was dirty and not just from the last housekeeping It was dingy a place where you needed the slippers they provided And this was a suite Also the refrigerator was caked with ice and didnt work Furthermore because my travel agent had mixed up the dates I was to travel I showed up a day late The hotel said it wasnt a problem and that I wouldnt be charged for the noshow the night before I had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day Then the Fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve Neither I nor my corporate travel desk will use the Fitzpatrick again Two dots only because its in a good location and because the lobby was clean Im generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad,negative,true
We booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown We where woken up at 600 in the morning with our bathroom flooded this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet We where moved to another room but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for The next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets coffee or towels which is just horrible service The service along with the orginal room where perfect but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel,negative,true
This hotel is a shamblesfurniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the socalled amenities The fitness center is an oversized closet We were appalled during our stay Truly anticipated warm Irish hospitality and short of a barman no one was Irish warm or hospitable Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request Her manager ? refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us Room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 730am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to RRI The manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the tradeoff,negative,true
The hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night For THREE consecutive nights There was simply inadequate soundproofing  even 14 floors above the street OK  13 floors as there is no 13th floor I hesitate to write this review but I rely on Trip Advisor reviews when traveling and had I been warned about the ambulance sirens I would have chosen to stay elsewhere If you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value Conveniently located Wonderful staff But quiet is a key priority for me so I would not stay here again ,negative,true
Id been searching for a cool nonchain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend I thought Id found a winner in the Affinia SOO disappointed In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed What? I was floored but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride was too tired to make a fuss We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple I was told that room service would call ME back to take my orderand nothing happened I didnt want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs Nothing special entree dessert and NAB for two still came out to *I am no hayseed Im WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago but this just wasnt worth it Our room was by the elevator w parking garage viewthe bathroom was tiny shower curtain was stained funky toilet seatlid and the vanity featured that rude awakening lighting normally found in lowrent dressing rooms ie Holy crap have I looked that bad this whole time? If youre a traveler who likes using the inroom coffeemaker they charge for their chintzy coffees I dont use these but come on Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar but weak drinks That night our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms But the Marathon was that weekend the hotel was so busy I didnt want to be a pest I cant believe I was so impressed with this place online Next time Ill happily pay more to stay someplace thats actually a treat,negative,true
I stayed @ Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Womens hospital oir my surgery Few things I really didnt enjoy  I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doorsNo noise insulation at all Very dusty between window framesI understand  carspollution but it looked like it wasnt cleaned for a very long timeOne more thing really made me upset  broken blinds on a right side I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep timeWe didnt notice the problem until veryvery lateThe Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families  which really need extra privacy and comfort  Strange but every hotel I stayed @ was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paperAffinia didnt even offer thatLooked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use Hopefullyno more surgeries for meWont stay @ this place for leisure  even with discount,negative,true
Having stayed at the excellent Affinia chain in NY I had very high expectations When I saw the Trip Advisor rating I immediately booked What a huge disappointment  The quality Simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap foam pillows  the kind they sell in the store for 4 You cannot sleep on these  The windows are so thin you can hear the buzzing from walkdont walk sign on Superior below  The walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked I was awaken around midnight my room engulfed in smoke odor A call downstairs yielded no results  There are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood the desk chair was full of loose threads  The water flow is very weak but the towels are nice  There are unpainted floorboards the kind you find in Days Inn  They charge for internet service The tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like The sign outside is also a banner Having stayed all over the US you are better off at Red Roof  this is really an embarassment for the Affinia chain Wait until they complete the renovations in 2008 I did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand Good heart but the problems are not fixable,negative,true
Ive been here for 4 days Great location right off of miracle mile near all major hotels best shopping and theatres Rooms very large Hotel staff very friendly and helpful and respond immediately Problems there frequently are homeless people even during daylight on Superior between St Clair and Michigan Avenue the main route you walk for or all activities and just about everything is in walking distance from here At night the street on the north side of Superior is dark and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors The street people do not approach you although they may stare as you go by Usually 2 or more along the way where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus I would not think a woman would feel safe by herself I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia There are homeless up and down Michigan Street but this is different as its a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street The entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation For now expect two extremely small warm slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm cramped hallways All the walls throughout the hotel need painting and the wallpaper is peeling in places In the room several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection the carpets were stained the bathrooms needed new grout some mold visible the TV is very small 16 Inch? and the windows very very dirty You wont get your room serviced unless you ask for it sometimes more than once The pub  downstairs is run down dark and kind of creepy Food and room service are very expensive as is parking 34day public and 38day valet On the plus side the bed was very comfortable there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St Clair street toward the north and south You can see a sliver of Lake Michigan Pool small but clean All in all it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room but I think it is overpriced and I would not stay here again,negative,true
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick before about 4 years ago it was ok The management was great staff was so kind and rooms were clean ** But this time I promised my self NEVER to go back The new staff was so rude I made a reservation for my Anniversary on the internet and the day of check in I was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation** 1 I was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline 2 Staff was extremely rude Not arrogant but rude Like they hated thier job 3 They offered check in at 1pm but the room wasnt ready till 3pm 4 There were stains everywhere 5 Because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff,negative,true

I wrote an email to the sales  reservation team a week agoim still waiting for a response All I wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer We have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails Shame you missed out coz we tip like rockerfellers,negative,true
Apart from the location great but it stops there Upon checkin I was informed I would have a queen bed I asked for a king size bed and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king GIVE ME A BREAK a surcharge for going from a queen to a king When I got up to the room it was like a oven I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service Everything in the room had a charge associated to it even down to the coffee 100 Now whats up with that? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom Very small I have stayed there twice and with so many other options I feel this will be my last,negative,true
We were encouraged to stay at the Affinia as part of a group in town for a Chicago wedding We booked our rooms 6 months in advance with the promise of a brandnew full service hotel in a great locaiton in Chicago The lobby was nonexistant under construction The front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful The hallways and elevators are small cramped and uncomfortable The rooms are great  great beds great television set NO ROOM SERVICE  the kitchen is under construction The bottom line is that during our stay this was NOT a fullservice hotel and should not have charged what they did We were totally disappointed hope it will improve but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of Chicagos truly amazing hotels It is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal,negative,true
me taking a cue from david dancer sup? front desk person yes? me so do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room? front desk person what room are you in? me **** front desk person oh im afraid so OR you can take the other elevators and take the fire stairs up to the 10th floor me oh? wtf so were staying at this hotel and there is a bar on the 29th floor but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room? get bent were paying to stay here not just drinking in your bar,negative,true
I only stayed at this hotel for one night the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy After the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I pushed the button until the elevator arrived never under 10 min even late at night I went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband 1 margarita was 14 I wanst drinking because Im pregnant so I had a soda water for 4 if I would have known I would have had tap water Overall great rooms OK staff  horrible elevators overpriced drinks,negative,true
I made reservations with the Chicago Fitzpatrick using their 800 number for two nights in June I received no written confirmation with cancelation policy etc However when I attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first nights reservation I was told that they would charge me for one nights stay They have a 3pm THE DAY BEFORE your first nights stay policy Even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy This is not a common policy on Michigan Ave Id advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy It was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel,negative,true
My husband and I stayed overnight at the Affinia Prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel not true Since it was a very special occasion and also because we were only staying overnight we didnt let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend However this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences Ive ever had First the smells The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy The odors were not mild and I found it pretty repulsive I couldnt wait to jump out of bed in the morning to get away from the odors Hard to sleep and certainly didnt want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary I didnt discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed At that point I chose not to contact housekeeping because a I was exhausted and b I didnt want to upset my husband who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing Also the bathroom smelled like vinegar Perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did Incidentally the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days not a wellmaintained property Second the elevators If you stay above the first few floors there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop cview bar With so many floors to service and so many people going up to the cview bar on a saturday these elevators took forever to come and were often full they did Annoying Also on one occasion there were several bottles water and soda left in the elevator clearly the maintenance crew doesnt inspect and clean the common areas frequently Finally and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived First when we booked we asked for as quiet a room as possible The hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital But its proximity to Michigan Ave and the lack of accomodations elsewhere due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same weekend led us to stay here anyway At checkin the clerk noted our request and said our room was quiet room since it was not next to the elevators When we arrived at our room we discovered that we were across from the elevators Obviously she was technically correct that we werent next to the elevators but it was still so close 1520 feet that we could hear the elevator noise Also since it was a special occasion we asked if we could upgrade The disingenuous snarky condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade Clearly the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels this is a matter of routine not exception Pretty awful experience all the way around Other reviewers must have very low expectations Cant explain any of the good reviews otherwise,negative,true
We connected to Affinia Chicago thorugh a city websight The deal was fair for a downtown hotel on the main drag with an attractiion included There was information out there that the hotel was being overhauled although we did not pay much attention to that They are currently under major construction They will be a little late of their projections in the finish date I must say that the staff tried very hard to make our stay comfortable under very difficult circumstances The room was complete and was good It had a very nice bathroom The main lobbie and all hotel amenities are totally unfinished drywall with no food drink or rest room opportunities The construction guys did their best to limit activity and noise to after 900am I think this will be a good one once they are done As of the end of May they have a way yet to go,negative,true
This hotel does not live up to the reviews The room was larger than I expected However the decor was a bit dated The bedding was ripped carpet was stained and the shower door was broken There was a long wait to the elevators and if youre on floors 26 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk There are no ice machines in this building so you have to request it from the front desk One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait I finally got the ice 10 minutes later Two days later I requested ice again Waited 30 minutes and just gave up While I was leaving I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said I didnt get a call for ice Well I obviously wasnt making it up lady I called and spoke with someone She didnt even apologize or offer me anything Overall I would not recommend this hotel There are so many hotels in the Chicago area Choose a different one,negative,true
Ive used Priceline for every trip Ive made back to Chicago and Ive been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East Its conveniently located near the ClarkDivision stop on the Els red line That is the best part of our experience When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens Ive never had that issue at any other hotel Ive stayed at The rooms decor was outdated and the TV was tiny The hotel charges for usage of Internet You could hear people in the hallway and when youre in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms We werent in Chicago to stay in the hotel however for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isnt the place read more,negative,true
The Ambassador East was a average hotel at best and mediocre at worst The bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff The doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you The room was lackluster however The bathroom was in especially bad shape It was dirty when we arrived with hair in the sink and shower The shower was in really bad shape The shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low The water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit The decor throughout the hotel lobby hallways and rooms was very outofdate and oldfashioned I would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well The business center with free Internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use The hotels location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations I would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms I might be inclined to stay there again read more,negative,true
I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood cost and amenities The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open you wouldnt know it You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a nicer historic hotel I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime It was a very frustrating experience,negative,true
I was initially very excited to be staying at the Ambassador East hotel The photos online appeared very classy and upscale and I thought staying there would be a pleasant experience Upon arrival I was very disappointed  the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around Our room was very dated  old furnishings and linens damaged tile  it fell quite short for the high price we paid It is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning Doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room  gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel,negative,true
In my experience the Ambassador hotel didnt seem to be a 3 12 star establishment The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated The carpeting was very old and worn The floor  carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel Currently its indespirate need of renovation,negative,true
We didnt stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room Saying that we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking Hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that wont have a car Not a family frienly hotel Dining tip Long walk from hotel Ginos pizza is a must have Worth the walk Many things in between hotel and Ginos to do so you can break up the walk,negative,true
The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding making it dark They charge a lot for internet hook up wifi is not included The staff was very slow I am assuming they were all new They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby The room was set up weird the bathroom opened facing the bed rather than the hall as most do Room temp was hard to control even though they had a digital thermostat Overall I was very disappointed had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels,negative,true
We booked through a travel website This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done The hallway was so dimly lit we couldnt see how to use the key card The shock came when we entered the room Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guests comfort into consideration The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground  a mattress rock hard over a platform The nigh stands were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height The room was stark  all offwhite no color No art work or any decoration at all The fulllength drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit if it were winter and the heat was on I think this could be dangerous There was a desk  chair but no clockradio in the room there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection The bathroom was very small but clean The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to An older person could have never stayed in the room Because of the renovation there was no restaurant onsite No vending or ice available on the floor either I cant see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel I would never stay there again,negative,true
I arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California I didnt know about the renovation when I made the reservations but that didnt bother me very much I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben who was friendly enough but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay He gave me NO information about anything I had no idea where breakfast was served or even if there WAS breakfast There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the deskshe wasnt wearing a name tag but was African American slim with short hair who seemed to be actually radiating hostility It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say made me feel unwelcome I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners No matter what may be going on in ones life when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile I was appalled by her demeanor My room was alright there was no clock which I found very odd Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct especially upon waking up in the morning It would have been nice to have a clock There was also no literature on local sites maps restaurant menus or even anything with the hotels name and address in the room Also the mattress was the absolute worst mattress Ive ever slept on in my life I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck Ive had better sleep on a hard lumpy futon It was absurd Like another person posted my tub did not drain either and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found Maybe they were around somewhere but I wasnt made aware of it at checkin and I didnt want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance but I absolutely would not stay here again Ive had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations,negative,true
As a regular visitor to Chicago and a freuent guest at the Ambassador East I was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit Room service has been eliminated despite the renowned Pump Room being located in the hotel there was no inroom directory the carpet was torn and stained no phone book the refigerator and honor bar had been removed and the room was so small I had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire I asked the desk clerk about larger rooms and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms  which is untrue as there are several larger room types He didnt even offer to check availablity of other rooms In talking with the consierge she blamed everything on upcoming renovations  which the hotel has been promising for more than two years All in all a very disappointing and expensive experience,negative,true
I can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a makeover 1 There was a huge gaping hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor I kid you not How can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm? 2 The furniture was severely chipped Ok I dont mind chipped furniture if I am slumming it in my justoutofcollegesisters apartment But for 170+ a night I want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive 3 The receptionist while I was checking in was super curt I know it was late but isnt that sort of your job? Not everything was horribly bad though The one star is for the bathroom that was super clean I do not recommend this place at all,negative,true
My friend book this hotel for us for a girls weekend in Chicago Lets just say we were thankful we didnt have to spend much time in the room The carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way The furniture was worn and outdated The place was gross and just wasnt worth the money we spent on it The only redeeming quality was the door man we was very nice and helpful,negative,true
The room looked like a country club prison cell Flat paint on all walls doors trims not especially clean A platform bed and a long shelfdesk with an iron chair No amenities no homey touches nothing on the walls No room service no gym no concierge The air conditioner clunked off and on all night On the plus side the bedding was nice and there was a large screen TV Dont waste your money,negative,true
Stay Away After generations as an oldworld cozy and stately if a bit tired oasis the AE has been purchased by Ian Schrager and taken down so many notches its almost not functional Allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation the entrance is not handicapped accessible and I saw several hotel guests with canes casts etc including myself recovering from foot surgery and in a cast with a cane struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel With luggage its almost impossible This is simply inexcusable Ive been a customer of the Ambassador East for decadesbut no more The hallways are so dark one can barely see The rooms are stark white which in and of itself isnt a particular problem but it is jarring and almost painful as ones eyes adjust from the dark hallways The furniturestark and scantlooks like something from an Ikea closeout The bed is comfortablewhat a reliefbut only about 15 inches off of the floor a real problem if youre at all physically challenged or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days The problems dont end there My room had a horribly uncomfortable wiremetal desk chair and absolutely nowhere else to sit No arm chair no demisofa no ottoman With a foot in a cast it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably perhaps even with my leg elevated while in the room No way The bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries Not a shelf a small table a nook or a medicine cabinet If you want to put a razor shaving cream makeup for women or anything else down so that you can use them youre sh*t out of luck Repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet A borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable something I didnt discover until caught in an expected downpour I was tempted to throw it out but remembered that they would charge me for it if I didnt return it in spite of its total lack of usefulness Refrigeratorforget it Shampoo? For two days in a row the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion and no shampoo Room servicenot available If you want breakfast the front desk will sell you a small prewrapped commercial grade muffin for 400something you can buy in any gas station for 100 No added value whatsoever The photos show a nice entrance and a large lobby for which the AE has long been famous Unfortunately that lobby is closed off under construction and the temporary lobby is on the second floor difficult again for handicapped access Thermosbottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold at 8 in the morning When confronted with these various misses the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said Yeah we know youre not the first to tell us this stuff All this shows is that Schrager doesnt even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right Its one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when its under renovation Its another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain particularly after booking a nonrefundable prepaid reservation Again avoid this hotel like the plague,negative,true
We traveled to Chicago to visit with our daughter who lives in the city To our suprise what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations Gone is the lobby and gusts are required to walk down to the basement to get the one elevator that is working to the second floor to register Our first room was recently renovatedstark white walls no amenities at all Guests had to enter the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room Modern furniture includes a bed that is close to the groud a cold blck slab functioning a a desh and metal chair No fride coffee maker iron or even a picture on the stark white walls We asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the 15th floor While this room was attractive we were greeted to jack hammers at 8 every morning The staff were all very nice but the accommodations were lacking lake shore drive,negative,true
The hotel is just ok Stayed there for 5 days when visiting friends They had a renovation going so there was no lobby bar or anything Just a decently furnished room for 200 usd The renovation was not annoying but i think they ahould charge much less untill its done You cant beat the location Very convenient especially if u like chicqgo nightlife,negative,true
When youre standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again The worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem they told me that it happens to the upper floors and I wasnt even staying on the highest floor as if that makes it ok I can look past the rustic decor of the room and take it for what it is  an inexpensive place to crash but cmon a girls gotta shower,negative,true
Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 56 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis not including our business travel Weve traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail We were not at all impressed by this hotel At 220night we were expecting a decent clean hotel but obviously not a 5* We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given 1546 The paintwallpapertub were peeling there was hair in both the tubtoilet when we got to the room the internet service was extremely slow the toilet ran throughout the night and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was I know we cant wait for our renovations If it hadnt been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK  booked into this hotel by a travel agent we would have checked out as soon as we checked in Let me also add that the front desk seemed shortstaffed as the checkincheckout process was painfully slow All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendlyresponsive door staff In its day this was likely a lovely hotel  but it is in dire need of a renovation Despite its location I cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a subpar experience We would never book at this hotel again,negative,true
has gone downhill so much we almost checked out We stayed in the Dean Martin Celebrity Suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in Chicago Weve stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the Four Seasons or the Peninsula it has always been a comfortable and clean service oriented hotel Not only has room service been eliminated if you want room service it comes from Marios Italian restaurant down the street so is ONLY Italian complimentary morning coffee is no longer available mini bars have been removed from the rooms etc etc The only restaurant the Pump Room was closed for a private function on Saturday night the bar also so we werent even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests Surely the function was planned before we made our reservations but we werent told of it We also learned that the bell staff who have been there for 13 and 8 years is being eliminated So in other words anyting to do with service is gone from this hotel I hear they are going to begin renovations in December but that is no excuse to let an old glory go to pot in the meantime We wont be staying here when we go back in July or for Thanksgiving We even had to pay for internet Mind you our bill for 3 nights was 90000+ no room service no restaurantbar charges Highway robbery for what you get ow at the Ambassador East Sad,negative,true
The Good  excellent location neighborhood is pretty and quiet close to shops restaurants the waterfront close to trainsubway station etc The Bad  Very old decor which isnt a big deal but the tv was smaller than my PC monitor We were supposed to have a king bed anniversary trip we were given two double beds and told we would be switched  that never happened The showertub was stopped up so bad that after I showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower Who wants to shower in someone elses dirty water even if it is your wife The indifferent  room was a decent size bed linens were okay staff was mediocre to marginally rude,negative,true
The Good LOCATION Views Decor Room Service Friendly Staff The Bad Shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked Bed was just Ok The Ugly Had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up I am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotels iPod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up Also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower The staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately Also they mentioned that they had AREADY been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers,negative,true
Went there for business and the Hard Rock Hotel on Wacker Drive was recommended I was to meet my girlfriend there who had arrived 1 hour before me When she go there at 6PM the room wasnt ready the phone didnt work the shower didnt work When I got there she was already very upset I called the manager to complain but was put on hold for 30 min I could hear everything in the room next to me as if there wasnt any wall separating us I asked for a wake up call but nobody called me the next morning When I called to complain the next day the told me the phone system was down Ordered room service and got the wrong order The building is very old and the elevator sounds like it is on its last breath I would not recommend it to anyone Patrick,negative,true
Not worth the price even a little bit A week prior to scheduled checkin receiving an email for a room upgrade and accepting of course upon arrival nobody knows about it Typical After nobody was doing anything about it I notified them of this stays review will be posted on the newlydeveloping TheChicagoCritic  Com all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early checkin Too little Too late Very small room with 2 queens instead of the Select King I was supposed to have Windows didnt open TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable The faboulous Lodge Net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests well there was no check out feature This shit hole couldnt hold a candle to the Las Vegas Hard Rock,negative,true
We stayed at this Hotel in February 2010 The room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for United Way So we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity We were woke up at 300am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor Of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours They were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on We called the front desk who sent security up immediately Security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave We called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down Because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted When we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate Well we still paid for it They would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had We would never stay at this hotel again obviously they really dont care about their guests,negative,true
Move beyond the rock theme and its an average hotel with a good location Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing Thank goodness the window opened or wed have been cooked alive That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting Room was stuffy too Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions Wife happy w Aveda in bath Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey,negative,true
Great building and location but staff is indifferent you have to pay for WiFi after 300 usdnight I would expect at least free WiFi no pool in the building and something I found really annoying is that if you move anything from the minibar they have sensors that automatically charge you This is ridicoulusThe iPod dock in the room didnt work Also we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over Definitely is not value for your money Youre just paying for the Hard Rock brand I will never go back to a Hard Rock Hotel,negative,true
at check in the girl gave us a smoking room we asked for nonsmoking i had to get another room it was by the elevators loud really loud the new room didnt have a shower door so every day water spilled on to the floor and wet the carpet the public transportation is amazing you dont need a car in chicago you can get anywhere by train or bus its fast too Area recommendations chicago is great good shopping good food ginos east and great bars the tornado that knocked out the windows in the sears tower was really cool i loved being in the hardest rain storm ive ever seen,negative,true
Our checkin was great but then we got into our room The carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower open concept leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it The mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room Our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine 69 instead of 50 When my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee It was adjusted but not without confrontation There was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same mysterious mini bar charge on her bill as well and was trying to have it corrected Overall the location of the Hard Rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one,negative,true
I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed The previous weekend I stayed at a 25 star hotel a few blocks away and was much more impressed there The Hard Rock had a number of issues including very dark room  not much light artificial or natural lots of street noise very cheap decor and furniture broken cabinet door very warm room  said they would send maintenance but they never arrived had bar charges on account that were not ours Overall I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel I expected a much better experience,negative,true
This morning I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences Ive ever had Hard Rock Hotel Chicago I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the Preferred Hotels group Upon checking in I was greeted by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show My room was poorly lit and dirty The deskdesk chair was covered in sticky dried soda pop or something else? which I had to clean myself so I could work The sound system was put to shame by my 10yearold daughters boombox No one rock star or otherwise wants to reach more than an arms length for toilet paper Everything is possible This includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the everything is possible line Great marketing fails with no follow through The inroom minibar policy ranks in my personal topfive most ridiculous business practices of all time Do you charge Steven Tyler 781 for opening his inroom fridge? Looking back I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty drafty overpriced bar with a horrendous wine list With the exception of the fact that I was leaving checkout was no better than checking in I wasnt even asked about my stay The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant I for one will not bring my business back to that location Next time Im in Chicago Im staying at the Hyatt Rock on TripStarr,negative,true
I had purchased this deal of off groupon Lets just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures when We layed down to sleep in our bed We lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed attached in photos we immediatly called the front desk The only thing they offered was a new set of sheets when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quicklyhid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean Then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos and they offered me a 68 refund I was very dissapointedand dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and I broke out on my face with ACNE i never had a acne or skin issues im positive something in those dirtyy sheets We drove 45 hours to enjoy Chicago and we stayed @ the hard rock based on reputatuion and unfortunitly we were very disspointed it was DISGUSTING I then wrote a Email to management and HEARD NOTHING BACK NOT even a response or apology I just really expected alot more,negative,true
Rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see The room we had at almost 400 a night was dingy and small Dont mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there it isnt They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasnt a choice The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again we called the Manager who did get it to us The staff did appear friendly although housekeeping totally disregarded our do not disturb sign and would call us on the phone Dont make the mistake of staying here but if you do walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is 3 plus 19% gratuity We ended up having to order delivery food brought to us This is the most overpriced over rated and dingy hotel weve ever stayed in Taxi to airport is 40,negative,true
This hotel was chosen for me for a business convention The lobby was pretty cool But the rooms were tiny and very dark I had a huge picture of Kiss above my toilet It was very hard to do my makeup or read because of the lighting The location is OK You have to walk a few blocks to get to the best part of Michigan Ave but its not too bad Be prepared for some sad sights after dark Apparently panhandling is permitted in Chicago  some cities will give you a ticket for begging because at night the beggars come out The saddest thing i saw was an older woman with her two grandkids sitting on a curb in the freezing snow on a 5 temp night Those kids looked terrible Unfortunatly its all up and down the wealthiest part of the city You dont see so many in the daylight Also the room service at the Hard Rock is pretty good Its plenty for 2 people I would not stay here again though I suggest the Omni Hotel,negative,true
HI HO HI HO off to Chicago we go Heres the skinny if youre hoping to run into a washed up rock star CeCe Deville for us and no the teenagers had no idea who he was you may want to spend your hard earned money here I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends teenagers for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance I mean come on it is supposed to be COOL Well it wasnt The Positives *It is in the Carbon  Carbide Building which is beautiful *The location it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use *The fitness center is very nice Cardio machines have individual TVs and there are head phones in case you forgot yours They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack *Checkin and out was quick and Valet was very courteous The Negatives *The rooms were small and ours wasnt clean pistachio shells on the floor The rooms were painted purplish gray we were on the Prince floor with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub *The cable reception was poor I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture *It isnt anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe *There was very little memorabilia *There is no pool and yes I knew this when I made the reservation To wrap it up I wont be staying here again If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton But that is a whole different review,negative,true
My wife and I just spent a long weekend at the Hardrock Chicago hotel and although I am not one to normally write long email I felt it necessary to bring some of the disappointing experiences from our recent syat 214 to 217 to your attentionIssues included Our friends ordered chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arriving on 214 and we never got them Our friends later on 216 asked us if we had received the strawberries and we responded no They then brought this to the attention of the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have received a complimentary bottle of champagne We were then disappointed again upon checking out however when we were accidentally billed for the complimentary champagne  which was later subtracted from our bill The inroom DVD player didnt work It was approximately 11 PM on 215 when we called the front desk for help with troubleshooting the issue The person responded friendly that Al the engineer will be calling you back shortly to help 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was Al A great and friendly guy but we were waiting for a call back not the arrival of a service tech  keep in mind it was late and we were already in bed When Al was not able to fix the DVD player he graciously told us order a movie on us  thru the inhouse movie selection The problem that didnt work either Again Al was awesome and called the service provider but they werent able to fix it until after midnight Finally after midnight Al called us back but by then the movie watching mood had sort of passed I ended up watching the film Hitman alone as my wife had already gone to sleepThe thermostat in our room didnt work regardless of the temperature we set it to set to 65 degrees  actual temperature = 76 degrees We had so many other unresolved issues that we didnt feel it necessary to voice any more read more,negative,true
This is a tough one to review as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average 2 is where it was Here are my tips and propscomplaints Room 1 Star I had a corner suite The room was pretty nasty actually 2703STAY AWAY FROM IT There was a CONSTANT banging noise from above When I first got in I thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding After an hour I knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong Well the sound continued on for 3 days Not that I minded too much as I keep things on for white noise but it sure would bug others Also there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa In addition it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa Also there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat I could not imagine all the DNA left on that thing either *gags* Bathroom Nice size but not great The faucet was lose really lose and the toilet would not flush right Service Great Everyone I encountered did a great job making me feel welcome Good stuff Food I had meetings there so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made It was really good much better than most hotels Bar Very cool Good music great service and good drinks The scene was decent as well Small bar but was not cramped So maybe other rooms are nicer well hell they better be Regardless if ONE room is like that especially a suite I have to think others are like that as well It is too bad though The views are great and they actually have windows that open big shocker for the city in general,negative,true
My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our pad Weve stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there Its not that way here These may be all ticky tacky things but they added up to us First of all the room We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with an Incredible view Well our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us That was all we could see So there was no view The room was muggy We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74 We woke up sweaty both days When we opened the window to get a breeze the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing The room was small and dark but it didnt bother us that much The bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in And we even joked about stealing the pillows We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster but they removed the charges no prob Throughout the entire hotel I counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia I thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel throw a Styx guitar on the wall and slap a HRH emblem on the outside The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation The location is good right on the south end of the mag mile but there are 1015 better hotels in a better location to shopping quality eats and Navy Pier If you have a car parking will cost you 38day which is prob normal for downtown The hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant The bar was small and trendy and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they didnt have a blender WHAAT???? A HRH without a blender? Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town???? Mind blowing I would never never never go back here Like I said there are many better hotels in much better locations I will stay at the HRH in Orlando or elsewhere again,negative,true
I was scheduled to stay at the Hard Rock in June but had to cancel I had booked the hotel back in January When I called six days before my arrival date to cancel I was told that I would be charged for my stay because I did not cancel seven days in advance I told the customer service rep that I had never heard of such a practice but she said in a very smug manner that I was told back in January I honestly dont remember being told of the cancellation policy but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel I for one will never stay at a Hard Rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice,negative,true
Not worth the price We almost stayed at a hotel for 110 a night but instead choose the Hard Rock for 180 a special We were located on the newly renovated Beatles floor The carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced Upon entering our room we found some cool Beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot Marilyn Manson portrait I think they were halfway done re theming the room At checkout they tried to charge us 11 for using the minibar which we didnt even open They removed the charge right away but I wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge Nothing special here If you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you,negative,true
My two girlfriends and I arrived at the hotel and found the hard rock had lost our reservation I had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying It wasnt until I started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would research the issue Ten minuets later she found our reservation Our room wasnt ready we were told that it would be ready at noon we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty Room was very small The bathroom shower sink and floor were filthy Room service trays sit in the hallways all day The next morning we called down to get towels they were never brought to the room we had to drip dry The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge Christopher He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub,negative,true
Great front desk staff the rest of the experience was dreadful The room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered We had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet adjacent to our room almost in the room itself They do these random room checks for the minibar as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of 9 peanuts The roomservice is also equipped with walkietalkies as loud as megaphones If you like sleeping in on your vacation dont stay here Also the hotel was under massive construction a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website SO we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it No discount because of the work and noise Id rather sleep in a box in the alley,negative,true
We chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds We anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel than some of the other larger high rise hotels We did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel When we checked Irena seemed very robotic and aloof The front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious The lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door Each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff just a blank stare and gaze The front desk staff was chilly and stiff no greetings no smiles and no personality They had difficulty answering simple questions or requests On the other hand the bellman Perry was great He was sociable and very service oriented He was aware of what is going on in the area He recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area and where to eat in the neighborhood He is authentic and he even asked us upon our return how was that restaurant? Tim the concierge was also supportive He gave us 10% discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores We had the largest suite We requested a rollaway extra charge when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10PM When the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed What made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned We were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned We called the front desk to ask to send someone The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening The room itself was pleasant It did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service The service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel,negative,true
I am not much of a complainer as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006 The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone The receptionist was outright rude but took the reservation without a mistake During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent the waiters the managers nobody was friendly nor tied to accommodate us [] We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 122 to have an after hours party The hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions When we returned from the reception at 1150pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends Nobody told us we cant do anything for you Are you sure that you arranged this? Two quotes so typical for this hotels staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again I understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste[],negative,true
Avoid The Talbot especially for group functions My inlaws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests They were lured in by promises from The Talbot that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide special personal treatment Nothing could have been further from the truth They failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception they persistently confused reservation requests they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests his wife and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight Now the worse part Mistakes are made even hotel managers are human but where a hotel which is supposed to be in the hospitality service can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error Case in point I had requested on several occasions when I made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card all expenses they assurred me that this would be no problem Of course when my brother his wife and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid Chicago after six hours of travel they wouldnt let them check in until they physically saw my card again despite them having my card on record and despite my explaining this to them over the phone My brother recalls the indignation of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card Then Another guest in this case my older brother came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby When I finally was able to get across town leaving a Cubs game early I again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account Again they agreed but never did anything about it In the end when my older brother checked out on Sunday he was told everything was alright but when he went to his ATM his account was frozen from unathorized overuse The hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained When he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events I spent Sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on Monday the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone calling The Talbot the credit card fraud division my brother etc trying to solve this situation The most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager who at one point suggested that I was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters this was a witnessed event and her insinuation was that I was lying and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake In the end there is no one running this place managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail When I was finally able to get the name of the general manager after two daysm neither he nor his assistant would ever call back The communication between the staff and mangement is nonexistant Fortuneatly the staff at the Signature Room where we had the reception was beyond excellent so the day was not lost but the The Talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests Try The Ambassador East same neighborhood cheaper much more professional staff,negative,true
The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges No  not a bit worn  very much so Im sorry to say Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave cant be beat and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons there were quite a few bumps in the road Number one the rooms are quite dreary  brown on brown is just so not pleasing The desk chair was so badly worn that the lift button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no were not grossly obese The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it  one to get him up to desk heighth one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door The towels were very well worn and thin although bath sized which was a plus The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting  suffice to say it was horrific We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables and they appetizers were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side served on a large white plate and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery storelike roll  very very sad Even the menu as limited as it was looked as though someones child had written it out The good news is that Chicago is a fairly wellread restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go Unfortunately for us the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid 325nt for our disappointments The good news is that the mini bars wares were incredibly wellpriced  whens the last time you had a 4 beer anywhere in a hotel? even if it was Bud and Bud lite  lol~ The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful and the bed comfortable The AC was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90s our entire stay Free wifi  YES And it wasnt horribly grindingly slow No need for the advertised upgrade for faster wifi Talbott  please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game Apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased but we were sadly not,negative,true
I selected the Talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online We have had wonderful experiences with boutiques Monaco Allegro and assumed this would be comparable Good points the lobby is beautiful and one staff member took roses I bought for my wife and arranged them nicely The many problems When my wife called with a question on our arrival day the agent could find no reservation  15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly When we arrived the lobby was stuffed with students nobody tried to manage the group several of whom pushed ahead to the checkin desk We left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle We finally were checked in after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms When we got there our room had not been made up from the last guest When we complained we were given an upgrade to a room that was old and uninspired Chairs are scuffed closet shelves are bowed the air conditioner is noisy and a wall lamp is loose The view is of a construction site Moviesondemand are dated We expect this from a budget hotel not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale When we returned after an evening out the card reader to open the main doors did not work One staff member admonished us really for not using the reader when in fact we had tried This was embarrassing as others were standing in the lobby I tried to access the hotels wifi network but was only given a 995 upgrade option I called the desk and was told to click past it which of course did nothing It wasnt until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked We are pretty easygoing we love good treatment and tip handsomely If we had only 1or 2 problems we wouldnt write In fact we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right The president wrote a letter and suggested others at the hotel would be in touchnobody ever was,negative,true
This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete The elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 530am and goes on into the night Dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 247 Worst of all the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating Ugh,negative,true
If you asked me two years ago I would have recommended the Talbott Hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked Now I have definitely changed my mind While this hotel is located in a nice area of Chicago surrounded by great restaurants shops and affluent people it has really begun to slowly downgrade As noted by my reviews I am incredibly serious about customer service If youre in the hospitality industry there is really no excuse for falling short in this category but alas the Talbott really has The door staff dont say a word the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things which they always are and the staff have an air of snobbishness Inexcusable since we the customers are paying to stay at their overpriced hotel Perhaps the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that I had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because I waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator which when it arrived was packed to the brim I get that its an old hotel but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction the other one overflows with people and I am forced to walk ELEVEN flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time which I didnt I will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting,negative,true
I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel after hearing all the good things about it Unfortunately it was a very underwhelming experience to say the least But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel First off it is located my favorite part of Chicago  the leafy affluent part of town that is Chicagos equivalent of Manhattans Upper East Side complete with sidewalks quiet treelined streets real oldschool townhouses instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums cute boutiques instead of Gap Banana Republic and other mainstream massproduced brands and of course Hermes of Paris which warrants a separate mention I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches cherry colored wooden furnitures area rugs and distinct artwork The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains I definitely love the room While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan getting a 400sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous ample bathroom double sink massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around do a chicken dance and strut my Herve and Louboutins in My only reservation was the lack of natural light  the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11thfloor room but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us so cant have it all Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service or lack thereof I mean seriously They dont call it the hospitality industry for no reason I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say a 3000room Vegas hotel First I called in to reconfirm my reservation The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent First off she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff to whom I had to explain myself all over again my pet peeve when it comes to onthephone customer service The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly nor was he at all competent either Case in point  he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving  it was about 1AM As a general rule I am never ever a big fan of room service having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity 105% tax and still expect a tip on during my days globetrotting on the companys expense account Think overcooked steaks lukewarm soup bread hard enough to knock someone out and icecreams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite So I really wasnt expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24hour room service but lo and behold they do I placed an order of chicken BLT which to my initial delight came in within 20 minutes Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of 2 on top of the 18% service fee refer above I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lays chips lightly salted flavor The bread looked like someone stomped on it the L and T looked like it was 2 days old the B was unrecognizable and the chicken was burnt and cold It was pathetic room service at its finest We did get the item taken off our bill rightfully so too but the front desk person was instead of apologetic defiant The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as highend as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving its quite an accomplishment in and of itself We wont be coming back unfortunately,negative,true
I had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise I asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day The next morning prior to being moved to a quiet room the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood About an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street The room was quiet but smaller and darker The mattresses in each room were very firm I would even say hard I asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same At checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside with other passengers The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later As recompense for the noise flood etc the hotel offered exactly nothing Not a great stay,negative,true
If location is the only thing that matters stay at the Talbott However my wife and I have travelled extensively throughout North America and Europe and I have never in my entire life seen such an inept housekeeping staff They are unprofessional noisy incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel They were yelling in the halls slamming doors and taking far too long to clean each room They come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for 3 The hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work  no discount was offered even after we complained several times The front desk staff was very polite but who cares?Theyre supposed to be nice I spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that I received a fair deal The room was subpar for the price even for an inner city hotel Stay somewhere else and have a better vacation,negative,true
Im sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room The hotel is not modern in the least  it feels like youre staying in your grandmothers attic Wallpaper is peeling off the wall not well lit very few outlets in the room  especially convenient ones none next to the bed or built into lamps terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am Even the location is off the beaten path  closest L stop is on the Red Line  so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring Health club is not on site either There are hundreds of other hotels I would stay in over this one,negative,true
Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth eventually the lodging deteriorates But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades Yes changes have been made like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance most recently But other things have gone downhill For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott but not this lessthanmaintained lodging I personally am shopping for a new home away from home,negative,true
I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators which are used all night long When speaking to the front desk I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor which I had requested for a better view I am looking at a brick wall and getting no sleep He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor and were aware of the noise problem Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this If you decide to stay here request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences This is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain,negative,true
I found this hotel in the Small Luxury Hotels of the World booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels I therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from England The Talbott was excellently located although i had a view of a building site and did have an ambience and some charm however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling I had to wait in the foyer well after check in time having previously attempted to check in earlier tired and in need of a rest while a final check was done to my room The valet parking was not outside when requested breakfast was not included in the price all the things requested of reception did not occur and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special I have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel I was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all,negative,true
I have stayed in the Talbott a few times and had always liked it This time was my first visit in 2 years and I was disappointed The hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced I had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window The lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright The bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room The AC unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off Having stayed there before I know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others I have been in and the risk is getting it again Other small things contributed  the lobby brownies are no longer there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee so you couldnt walk out with the coffee and I got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5night stay The construction noise was not too bad but does start at 730am and goes on until around 8pm including weekends,negative,true
We reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay After checking in and unpacking we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed supposedly during renovation The front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room Colleen one of the managers was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem We ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed We never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently absent from the hotel during most of our stay We stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence We had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology The lack of training of the staff was clearly evident as was the cavalier attitude of the management,negative,true
I can easily say this is one of the worst hotels Ive stayed at the The receptionist up front was a snooty sarcastic teenager or post teenager You can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner The room was dirty stains on the carpet the showerhead was moldy and rusted the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches The towels had a horrible aroma The hotel is very narrow so we were near a construction zone so I would plan on waking up at 6am if you choose the Talbott The next day I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room That room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop I asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day if were not out by noon I had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm Please stay away from this hotel I think a Holiday Inn would be better Andrew F Gulli,negative,true
Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago We decided to stay at the Talbott and we reserved a room there over a month ago I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful but the accommodations to be quite disappointing We were given room #1605 Avoid this room at all costs The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night and then awaken you at 6 AM In addition we had requested a king bed and #1605 has two doubles We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room Despite the very friendly staff and its super location the Talbott was less than what we expected and we would probably not stay there again,negative,true
I cant recall another time Ive had to deal with such rude front desk help While pleasant initially as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for checkin I arrived prior to checkin time so they were holding a few bags the true quality of this establishment surfaced Never mind that the luggage wasnt sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 730pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop While that was a bit annoying the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna the very attractive but aloof front desk employee Her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning I also booked a rate that included parking which Donna acknowledged at checkin but at check out billed me separately I assume after I got on her bad side Even with my last polite good bye to the front desk I felt a phony uppity attitude from Donna and I really cant convey the extent of how insulting it felt I can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago The hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy Great location as well To be fair most of the staff seemed very friendly and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier But I think most travelers like me would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service so as to not have a situation that could singlehandedly ruin a travel experience Unfortunately that was the case here,negative,true
Do you imagine getting there for the first time and overlooking the room that was supposed to be ready with used towels and the mouthwash opened and used? what about when they left the towel for the floor the foot towel to dry my face? what about the slippers that although being still in the bag had all the sole broken and left tiny plastic parts over the way to the garbage all over the room de facto i didnt realise that would happen to me until i saw paris hilton on tv and then i knew god is great and he did it to us for being such an idiots to go to a company that has been able to create her shame on us actually,negative,true
We choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel Not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay We did  as recommended  have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there There is no breakfast buffet  you order a la carte Keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet Also note that the minibar is empty on arrival  we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order We have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience I dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel,negative,true
I live in Chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances We recently put up a candidate and his family we were recruiting for our company at the Conrad We had had good luck with this hotel when it was a Le Meridien It was a disappointment for all concerned as a Conrad On the plus side our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room On the downside They learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub only a shower Our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it which they had to clean themselves When the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some they were told it would be delivered immediately When they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had forgotten While the concierge and doorman were quite helpful our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive Our guests were generally under whelmed by one of the five best hotels in Chicago Conrad has a long way to go to compete with the Four Seasons Peninsula and Park Hyatt,negative,true
The Conrad Hilton recently took over this property from the failed Meridian Hotel It seems that the Conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesnt work The entrance is very difficult to find There are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby As a result there was often a line waiting for them The same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area If you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay you will find the poor elevator layout annoying The King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels Although I like modern design the room was quite stark and cold It was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear The bathroom was the best part Has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk? It was the most uncomfortable setup Ive experienced The views are nonexistent for most of the rooms In a city with amazing vistas this was disappointing I saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them Room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay Excellent food and high quality presentation Sorry I couldnt write a better review Would I stay here again? No Chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them,negative,true
Great awesome service Seriously the people are amazing That and the nice bartender who serves after last call at least thats what I was told  I of course dont drink save this place from one star But seriously blah small nonluxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable  and for a card rate of 725night even in a major city the rooms better be awesome Ive had waaaay better rooms in NYC for 350night Good thing I had a corporate rate And my room was not especially big despite what the below reviews say But heres the main problem Even on the 10th floor the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 and 615 and 630 and 645 and 650 and 655 andand well I finally got up and said screw it lets greet the day Maybe everyone else was already up but somehow I doubt it Am now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons,negative,true
Weve stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service  the staff wasnt rude just incompetent For example we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel Nonetheless the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs The list of issues goes on unfortunately including the low grade inroom movie options  our audio and video did not sync on our rental we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes And the room itself was not clean the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold Clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities but training or sufficient staff oh but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same Find a newer hotel there are many in this great city,negative,true
I was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the Olympia in Seattle The decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not inspiring Biggest disappointment was the inadequate internet connection in the room The wireless was very slow and the hardwire from the wall did not work at all I did request a replacement of the wall wire but it did no help This hotel can do better than this With a 5 star rating it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered  but was just a mediocre experience for me Even the bed covers were not that special Needs more intense management Next time I will try the Trump facility Thanks,negative,true
This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners The decor is lovely and a nice holdover from when this was a Le Meridian While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula the Four Seasons the Ritz and Park Hyatt it falls short We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection While the prices were similar to the Peninsula we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try Wow were we ever disappointed First off we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7 OK thats fine and we sat down The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong so that she could make it right When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full 20 per glass she consulted with the manager and then another manager a heavier fellow in a dark suit She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses What bothers me is not the outcome but the fact that the management is not service focused At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure it would be made right At the Conrad the Terrace manager just ignored it,negative,true
Booked a room w a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE and was rather disappointed Bed was either the worlds smallest queen or was actually a double not to mention it was uncomfortably springy Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used qtips Lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly When the tv was off there was a very audible highpitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv Hot water was very inconsistent in the shower It is in a great location however next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business but I wouldnt recommend it for a romantic night or two,negative,true
I stayed here 2 nights for a business conference The food was pretty good And they had these really good mints that I couldnt resist The room was very comfortable and the bed was great But I was annoyed by many issues First their internet went down for a couple of hour when I was there on a break from the conference It wouldnt have been big deal except I needed to do some business while it was down Second the internet wasnt available in the conference rooms I suppose the conference I attended would have had to pay extra for it Third The chair in the room was too low for the desk so I was in an awkward position while using my computer which gave me a back ache later Fourth on the second night my key didnt work So I asked for a new one which also didnt work So I asked for another one and the same thing happened Thankfully the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so I didnt have to go back down to the lobby a third time Then he came back a little later to tell me I was in the wrong room which I wasnt Finally he came back with the right key Fifth the TV had one remote control for changing the channels and a different one for the volume Sixth they didnt have the comedy channel Much cheaper hotels do If this hotel didnt cost so much money all of these things would be minor inconveniences but I would expect more for what I paid,negative,true
The Conrad has all the right stuff  great bedding fancy decorations beautiful lobby etc However they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to detail When I checked in I went to get a glass of wine from the minibar only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm I called for help and was cheerfully told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it In the meantime I said great but what about a cold drink? They proceeded to send me 1 glass of wine via room service without asking me if this would be okay I paid 25 for 1 glass of wine The minibar bottle wouldve given me 2 glasses for about 33 Nothing was said to me about this obvious difference When I called to complain I was made to feel cheap To me it was not the money it was the principle The next morning my bill showed that I had eaten something out of the minibar I had not I called and they said that the automatic sensors in the minibar must have triggered something duh  when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its compartment to fix it and they took the charge off They also took 10 off my room service bill but I was still annoyed that nobody bothered to apologize or acknowledge the fact that I was overcharged Also when they fixed the minibar fridge they did not replace anything in it The guy said itll take a while for things to cool down Oh really? How about the warm beer that was once cold that will now taste disgusting? I guess theyre saving that for the next person who checks into my room and has no idea Another annoyance was that the lighted mirror in our bathroom did not work When I plugged it in it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off and then it never would come on It seems that the Conrad thinks it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful without worrying about each customers experience I dont think they go into the rooms and check them out And their sta,negative,true
Well this used to be a Le Meridian Hotel and it has changed for the worse We kept having to remind them we booked a package because we were being overcharged separately for everything when it should have been included We were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival and did not Two phone calls and three hours later it finally showed up We tried to have a drink in the bar and even though we were the ONLY people there three serversbartenders came and went talking to each other not one of them acknowledging us After ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink And dont bother to pay extra for City View because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall  that is all we could see Oh yes the valet lost his cell phone in someones car and called me at home today to see if we found it He wanted me to call him back at home Nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff huh? For the money stay at any other hotel in Chicago with the same pricepoint and it will be much much better,negative,true
Its so frustrating when a hotel posts a deal prominently on its website claiming said deal is available on certain dates But when you call to make a reservation based on that deal they tell you its not available There are rooms available but not the deal Then they try to condescendingly tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal I get that Then just SAY that on the website Heres a great deal    but only a small number of people will actually get it So much for the great reviews about service    I couldnt even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed Bad form Conrad bad form,negative,true
Let me first start by saying I have always been pleased with the Conrad hotels and that is why I chose the Conrad Chicago I was very disappointed in the level of service 3 phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant front desk not aware of room eminities and a very uncaring MOD All the Conrad hotels I have stayed at have been 5 STAR but not this one I have to give it 2 stars,negative,true
My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad unfortunately we would never stay in this hotel again The rooms looked nice but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink The room service cost was super high  costing us over 100 for 1 burger 1 order of french toast 2 pops and 2 desserts In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room we were on the 5th floor same as the reception desk They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower The staff was friendly enough but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems There was not even a coffee pot in the room Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price NOT worth it,negative,true
I stayed in this hotel for a week and I was looking forward to a stay at a top class hotel I was shocked and disapointed with my stay Here are some of my gripes  Room had a broken phone and broken lightbulb  Breakfast service was slow and impolite  Hotel rationed shampoo one bottle for two people sharing and did not refill a bottle that was less than half full  We also shared a bar of soap I was so disappointed with this hotel I paid for a premium hotel and got a very disappointing stay,negative,true
 Barely Average Hotel at Premium Price This hotel has a beautiful lobby but fails to fails to maintain its standards beyond the lobby I have stayed in the Conrad in Dublin Ireland and in HongKong both of which I loved I was looking forward to staying at this hotel I was extremely disappointed I am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the Conrad name Pros Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments  Stained and worn out carpet in hallway  Room was small  Phone and lightbulb in room were broken  Breakfast was 60 for two people service was slow and impolite  Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct I would not stay at this hotel again It just is not worth the premium price they charge,negative,true
I travel to chicago quite often and have stayed at a bunch of hotels I stayed at Conrad a couple of times My impression was not too good Both times the receptionist was quite cold and I didnt feel welcome at all The room was noisy Thin walls and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about One time the tv was broken too and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it Anyway given that this is a 45 star hotel it really didnt live up to my expectations After the 1st time at this hotel I thought I might give it a second try After the 2nd time I decided I am really not coming back especially given that there are so many other hotels close by The other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel So I guess I am not alone in this,negative,true
I gave the Conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably The hotel will not honor room requests I expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation I got there and my view was of the adjacent office building windows I didnt pay nearly 400 a night for that I called down and the manager was absolutely rude That wouldve required you to pay at least 40 more Rude Lots and lots of mistakes happened Requested pillows were never sent up the television sound was not functioning ie NO sound when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little Ive had better service at a Hampon Inn When they screwed up our breakfast vouchers I had to physically go down and question it they said we will send them right up No that never happened Absolutely ridiculous The bathroom has always been nice and the room had been renovated since I was there last year thank the lord It had a nice ambiance to it The bed was quite nice as well The valet guys were fantastic probably the nicest men within that entire hotel Also the bellman and housekeepers were wonderfully sweet and always said hi or hope you have a wonderful day I appreciated that Perhaps the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service Breakfast at the Conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely The service was abysmally inept and not to mention slow We had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice They looked like they hated their jobs and treated us with the same attitude We were never checked on after the food came The food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking I got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin burnt a small croissant and a tiny cinnamon roll 14 dollars for that Laughable Or if you choose for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice Spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money Overall the managers need to learn what customer service means and how to bend over backwards for a customer Otherwise your business will crumble And the Conrad has crumbled for me I spent way too much money on terrible service Ive already sent my opinions to Hilton headquarters Ill be looking at other hotels the next time im in Chicago,negative,true
I booked this hotel with great expectations I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago Upon arriving to the hotel at the exact time I indicated in my reservation I was told Ive been downgraded to a lesser quality room I travel very often and never had this before Moreover I did not hear a single Im sorry it was like usual business What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me I will decrease the rate for you what do you think nice eh? like he was doing me a favor They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course which is the legal thing to do since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value I did not know what to say since this never happened to me before also with family present did not want to start arguing The rooms were nice not as nice as I thought and location is good however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this That is enough for me not to go back again,negative,true
If I didnt have to stay here I wouldnt Without exception I swear I am not lying every day of my stay brings a new problem Over the past 3 months I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time problems every time From the wrong food with room service to room keys that dont work unrefreshed bath towels forgotten and dirty inroom coffee service unclean ice bucket overnight forgotten room cleaning inability to connect to the InternetIm too tired to keep writing all the problems For the price of this chichi downtown hotel I expect more Finally their team is certainly not trained in customer service The front desk teams have attitudes and Arias hostesses think they are something else Im stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon but I would never go back if I had a choice The only good thing is the food at Aria  outstanding,negative,true
Fairmont Hotels are generally my preferred choice but this was a true disappointment Checkin was quite slow and problematic glitches with their reservation system locally Room was very small and oddly arranged Felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk Hotel overall felt quite cold and isolatinglobby is not at all inviting and it didnt feel terribly safe walking around outside Gift shop was overpriced even for a downtown hotel Food was disappointing Overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of A Fairmont ive come to count on Bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out,negative,true
They rave about their beds but the beds were average On surface room seemed clean however dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust It appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall The repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole Impossible to have a decent shower or bath EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death There was even a 10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room really For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20% gratuity Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity I have already been charged for him to deliver the food The parking fees were outrageous at 51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public Upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing I reported the theft to the hotel Had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days It has now been over two weeks No follow up no apology even given We will never stay at this hotel again We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at,negative,true
Maybe it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest  couldnt get a room thru Fairmont website as busy weekend with Ryder Cupbut never have had this experience in using priceline before The night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful We were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a ugly room We had comforter with dirt in several places  and a bathroom for handicap with no counter space  had to use ironing board for toiletries This hotel is huge and not at capacity  may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby Hallways rooms carpet run down  just not what you come to expect of a fairmont I have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst Maybe because we were on a low floor it was not updatedwe paid as much as other guest and Im a Fairmont Gold member Positives  great location daytime staff helpful at desk  they have two bikes to borrow which is handy Views could be great if you get a higher room Checked out the Raddison Blu across street  looked much nicer,negative,true
I was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle but affected me and my husband For example he got locked out of our room 2 times once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony so that was stressful because he lost some time The keycard just would stop working Then a fuse blew so we had no power while trying to get ready It happened to me also coming back from the spa and I called on the hallway phone to get help Luckily right after that an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting longas if she knew this was a problem I said no and she called down to check Apparently no one had even called Security to get me back into my room She had a set of keys and let me in thank god Then on our wedding night my husband wanted to order from room service It was a little after 1030pm We were told that room service was closed for the nighteven though all the literature in the room brags about 24 hour dining That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off so maybe thats why people werent too intersted in providing good service I dont think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again BTW the spa is great to hang out in even if youre not doing a massage,negative,true
Beautiful hotel but doesnt have a lot to offer for the price Sheets and pillowcases in the room had stains on them TV remote would not function properly Valet service truly needs improvement We payed quite a bit for overnight parking and it took them almost an hour to bring our car to us when we needed to leave When we asked to find out what was taking so long we got tossed back and forth between bell hop and front desk with no answers,negative,true
My experiences at the Fairmont Chicago were less than desirable I try to be fair when I write my reviews but fair is not in the Fairmont Chicago language From pulling up to check in I felt the gouging start 54 a night for parking is terrible for this area 3035 is the average and that is not affordable as it is but 54 is just disgusting to put on your guests The parking was more than my car rental In the room the internet is not complementary it is 16 for standard and 25 for some sort of ultra upgraded internet service Gouge gouge gouge who charges for internet anymore and even worse upgraded services I didnt go online every day of my 8 day stay because of the cost One update on the internet that they dont tell you upon check in is that if you sign up for the free premiere Fairmont club you will receive free in room internet service I found that out on the last day of my stay Other issues with this property is the shower pressure is not very good The bed was hard and uncomfortable And I would say there are many other properties that have a better location and price in the city On a good note the Aria resturant in the Fairmont has a tremendous staff and serves up the best burger and fries I have ever had loved the complimentary naan and dips to start and the complimentary orange bark to finish,negative,true
The hotel is well located but the service is poor They seem to cater to large conventioneers with service more like a moderate chain hotel  not your typical Fairmont There are too many specifics to outline here lets just say that from the front desk to the spa room service which only got my order correct oneday to housekeeping which didnt even clean my room one day although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room Yep thats just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings They did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience The hotel is large and many times between 57 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator Ive stayed at this Fairmont twice The 1st time I attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price But its not worth enduring such poor service That was the last time for me,negative,true
We stayed at the Fairmont two Saturdays in a row and both stays were disappointing We had to call the hotel prior to each stay and both times it took the hotel 3040 minutes to answer their phone For the price we expected nicer decor it looked cheaply done more comfortable bedsthe mattresses were too soft and the sheets too hardpillows werent comfortable either a more accomodating front desk staff Our friends who were also there on the same dates will undoubtably add similar comments,negative,true
For a supposed 4star hotel I was not very impressed at akk The lobby was nice and modernlooking but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors we didnt arrive that late at night Additionally when we walked into the hotel late one night there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in Where was the staff to clean up? Thats not a very welcoming sight The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue andi it was also a little too far south Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night,negative,true
My family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early August We were promised a room with two double beds When we arrived earlier than most we were told they were 45 double beds short We reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed We had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away Little did we know we were being CHARGED a daily fee for this bed The managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel The bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night The managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating We were so disappointed in this hotel Also they do not have a pool here If you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay 20 a day to use it 80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous Do yourself a favor if you want to be accomodated and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise go elsewhere Chicago has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one I never heard back from managment on this issue when I called and emailed so obviously they dont care even when I told them Id write a review on this website Chicago is an awesome city though We loved it,negative,true
Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay This hotels fivestar rating needs a downgrade When I visited this hotel 14 years ago The Fairmont was among the classiest brands No more My 29th floor room was expansive but dark  only one small window and one light was not working The upholstery was frayed the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water and the rooms door didnt close unless you pulled on it in a certain way Worse the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser It was like sleeping in an old vending machine but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message there was none to be found Other reviewers remarked that this hotel needs updating but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame For instance someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations I couldnt sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open  the space wouldnt accommodate my legs I am not unusually tall There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars that the Fairmont shouldnt be able to compete See my profile for better ideas Niftyc,negative,true
The bathroom toilet leaked water all over the bathroom every time it was flushed so we called maintenance to have it fixed We returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in grease There were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our guestroom towels to clean their hands and tools We love Chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again,negative,true
Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel The amenities were a smoke screen nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase Being charged 15day for Internet on top of a 250night rate was a bit over the top The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient The shower was a nice size with a fantastic oversized shower head unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost The staff were friendly and helpful actually the best part of the stay were the staff All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room,negative,true
I was very disappointed with the hotel this time They seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit The clientele also seem to be of a lower quality The lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice The house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room I think I will have to stay with the InterContinental next time,negative,true
We were disappointed with this hotel The staff seems hurried and unhelpful Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests The blower in the hallway blew freezing air but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it The lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit The room and bed was comfortable but the cream and and modern art work are not our style The room lacked many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer Certainly not worth the rate compared to other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago,negative,true
I stayed at the Chicago Fairmont for four nights for a conference My fiance accompanied me When we checked in we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed So instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like Ward and June Cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house We discovered that the coffee maker wasnt working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it and waited two and half hours We had issues with the plumbing including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill The toilet stopped working twice We returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room sitting on the bed watching the tv and talking on her cell phone They bellman were rude and wouldnt let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment There were errors on our bill Last but not least we saw a ROACH in the drawers Alive The restaurant downstairs was decent and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the Hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better I will never ever stay here again under any circumstances,negative,true
This hotel was chosen by my husbands company as the family came along for the business trip The location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor My first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean The lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance but was otherwise ok Lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long Seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there I had read from another reviewer to join the Fairmont Presidents club and wifi in the room would be free We signed up for the club but were puzzled as to why they dont just offer everyone free wifi Parking fees were exorbitant at 58night but thankfully the company was paying for this We were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel The hotel is NOT kidfriendly in terms of restaurants or amenities There is no swimming pool but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door there is an underground tunnel that connects the Fairmont there We loved the Swissotels pool on the 42nd floor Fantastic views from the pool Although the beds were comfortable my daughter and I were both victims of bed bugs during our stay Unfortunately we didnt know until the next day after we returned home Apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear My daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips The bites made you want to claw your skin off My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all Beware of room 3405  bed nearest the bathroom I will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on,negative,true
This hotel has a great location and very friendly staff However the physical condition of the property has certainly fallen behind the competition I use to be a regular at this hotel    but have not been back for 15 years Rooms have not been well maintained old carpets frayed at doors wall paper peeling off of the walls TVs from the 80s There is currently construction going on in the lobby area making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door,negative,true
no bell boys there when you need them sully staff no smiles at all in this place had to wait 30 min for my luggage and was never greeted by any of the staff boy sure is a lousy fairmont compared to the one in SF never here again,negative,true
Our trip was our annual anniversary trip The hotel did not honor my choice of king size bed Instead we received two double beds This seriously decreased our enjoyment of our stay at the Hyatt There were two cups of coffee complimentary in the room No complimentary coffee anyplace else in the very large hotel Location was more of a business district not appropriate for pleasure trip Employees of Hyatt were very friendly and helpful other than the failure to deliver the reserved room,negative,true
The room was dingy and run down  it felt like staying in a cheap motel The carpet was exceptionally worn wallpaper peeling bathroom grout dingy The place felt like it hadnt been redecorated in 30 years On top of that the windows would not open not unusual for a higrise hotel and there was no air fan for ac or heat  how the temp control was supposed to work I have no idea they said radient cooling whatever that is but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated So much for privacy I cant comment on the food because we ate out at every chance Chicago has some fantastic food And much of it within easy distance to the hotel The hotel is in a good location near the waterfront and millenium park shopping and dining The conference facilities were average but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was nonexistent I will never stay in this hotel again especially for the price because of the poor room quality,negative,true
First let me say I try not to be too critical but in some cases the truth is warranted We checked in and things seemed fine Location was excellent Woke up the first morning to a slightly rumpled bed covered in stains I hopefilthy and not 4 star hotel quality Requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door a gentleman was there to let me know if I wanted it done to take off the privacy sign I did and no one even came until later in the day The room was big enough had no drawers suposedly remodeled but carpet didnt reach the wall toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken The mirrors were great and the water was always hot The walls were paper thin I heard every conversation the guests next door had They were not noisy but you could hear everything including the tv through the walls and vents Internet was 1300 worked for a bit and then not again I called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later The hotel did give us a credit for the charges At this point enough was enough we packed our bags and checked out The front desk was very helpful kudos to Rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops,negative,true
My expectations were not high because I booked this hotel through priceline for 58  night An amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15  20 minutes for hot water I called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water  to which they nonchalantly replied try running it for 15 to 20 minutes They forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower if anyone else expected to use the shower My boyfriend who showered after me had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again To make matters worse after room service was delivered we called and said we needed another fork They told us it would cost 3 1 for the fork 2 for delivey charge Absolutely ridiculous At least with a 1 star hotel you get hot water This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel I guess you do get what you paid for  I just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price,negative,true
Thank god I got this hotel through priceline I cant imagine paying full price for this place The tub was moldy and dingy The toilet didnt flush Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least Unless you wanted to pay 5 for a rerun of an NBC show Oh and internet? Why that will set you back about 15 for the day And breakfast? Thats about 16 for a cup of coffee a croissant and two slices of honeydew This hotel is the pits The customer service isabsent When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby decked out like some bad late 80s prom theres no one to direct you upstairs to the check in And once youre there check in is very fast ill grant them that This hotel is a big crummy ripoff I will never stay here and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe,negative,true
The lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in The only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed When we got to our room we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room I am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable The walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us When we went to breakfast we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived For the price they were charging the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere It also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car For forty dollars a day for parking we expected better,negative,true
The Chicago Hyatt Regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellationie the room cannot be cancelled I recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel The reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72hour cancellation policy However when I tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe Robert the reservation supervisor said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room He said that I should refer to the confirmation email that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking  nonrefunable This clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone I told him to cancel without being charged In response he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay Why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price? The bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement and Robert should go back to customer service school,negative,true
staff was very courteous desk clerk gave only one coupon for the free breakfast instead of two second desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day causing us to miss the free period room was very clean with a nice view of the river bed was very comfortable toilet looked like it belonged in a public restroom no tank instead it had a stainless steel valve instead of a 4star hotel no dresser to store clothes no wastebasket in the room and there was a cover for the icebucket but no icebucket folding luggage stand had a broken strap location was good close to the river several americanstyle eating places nearby overall a disappointment for a fourstar hotel i expected more for a hyatt regency,negative,true
They allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water We called security twice for them to do nothing about the party When they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes When we called back nothing was done about it My 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing THEN we get up the next morning at 730 to get ready only to find that we have no running water After the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep They did not resolve this issue They just keep passing my complaint to managers supposedly It was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it,negative,true
THE ROOM I booked a room here and was told Id be getting a king bed When I check in they say they only have a queen bed room available I protested to no avail When I got to the room it was really only a full size bed So I went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in Chicago For the pleasure I paid the same price as a normal king bed room The full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable I think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses We would wake up with body aches and headaches My wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights Not good Also the internet in the room is hard to setup slow to use and inconsistent I generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work The internet worked one day on my iPhone and then would not log me in Its not really worth it ROOM SERVICE Room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical Some mornings they would take our towels even the ones we hung up to use again and not replace them other times they would replace some towels and not others They would also come at vastly different times HOTEL SERVICE This hotel LOVES to nickel and dime I asked for a fridge in the room and they told me itd be 25 No other hotel Ive ever stayed in regardless of how many stars it had has ever charged me for a fridge in the room Late checkout? charge Shuttle from the airport?  nonexistent The front deck gold passport people cant even figure out how to get you points In the end I will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay not that i plan on staying at a Hyatt property again By the way apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my minibar was missing I was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying 25 THE HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower The west tower has some underground amenities no one uses The bars are extremely expensive but the drinks are tasty The food is edible too but I wouldnt brag about it The hotel is not directly on the main street Michigan but its not too far from it Its right next to the boat tours and in some rooms has a view of the Navy Pier Our room faced another hotel but we could see a sliver of the pier The hotel is walking distance from Millennium Park Its a bit of a walk to any of the L stations though If you want a wonderful breakfast place go to Wildberry on Randolph st Itll have you waiting to eat for a long time but its yummy CONCLUSION I get better rooms better beds better service and better amenities at a Holiday Inn Express or a Best Western Save the money and stay elsewhere,negative,true
The room was very spacious with very nice colorful decorating The beds felt like lying on a cloud and there were four pillows on each bed two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better The bathroom was very nice also Overall I was very pleased with the stay You had to show your room key to get in after ten pm I thought that was a good security issue It has a great location too close to downtown I would recommend it The decorations were very classy Most hotels have two of the same framed art boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows The Hyatt Regency was just the opposite,negative,true
My family and I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker Dr on March 27 2012 We were excited about the great price we got for your 4star hotel through priceline Unfortunately we were not impressed In the past we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown San Diego for spring break on the Marina but chose to stay closer to home this year The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived even though we paid for an upgrade We asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after Upon our return nothing had been moved in the room to reclean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume it wasnt even checked as promised We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more They were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it the honor barfridge was gouged and dirty too The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on  not neat and tidy at allThere were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well Very disappointing to say the least I have buyers remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds We were compensated for our upgrade  2000 but given the price of parking taxes and etc at this point I wouldnt recommend this Hyatt to anyone My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4star hotel I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility,negative,true
This was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago The first time was far above our expectations for a 69per night room The rooms are very nice and the beds are comfortable This time we got a great rate through travelzoo @ 104 night for a room with a view We were aware of the 41 parking per night The first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldnt park they were full We had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking garages It was a Saturday evening Finally found a spot and were told that it would be 38 This was 6 blocks from the hotel Mind you its 6 outside and we have luggage to carry too Not very good service for a 5star hotel We got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby its called the harddrive Thats cool and all yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room it wasnt an issue The HVAC controls to our room were broken The first night we were ok but by the second night it was blazing hot in there 86 degrees So hot we couldnt sleep It was miserable They sent up the engineer and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window 24 floors up It never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night It was 5 below that night and the window being open 8 didnt help They would not put us in another room either At checkout Monday morning our bill came to 24043 after taxes for the room We then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for 5665 Cool I got my reciepts and went on our way On Wednesday I was on my online banking checking my account to find that Hyatt charged me 28903 and another charge of 10363 That is almost 100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say I was furious so I called the hotel Nothing was resolved by my phone call they treated me as if 100 isnt but something you wipe with She said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off That didnt settle well with me but what could I do I waited Its Friday now I check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts and they still have authorizations on the two incorrect amounts as well They have charged me an additional 300 Im so furious and guess what Hyatt doesnt care They gave me the same [] line as they did Wednesday SAVE YOURSELF SOME HASSLE AND DONT STAY AT THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY FOR THEM TO PLAY WITH,negative,true
I havent stayed all that much with Hyatt and Im not sure if I will be going back anytime soon The staff was very professional and helpful Our room was close to being 4 stars however fell a little short It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush Im not a germ freak or anything however I really dont want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I dont have to The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention FCCLA and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it The noise at night from every direction The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party Coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic With little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another absolutely ridiculous The lobby of the Hyatt at night was a complete Zoo During our second night I finally had enough and called to complain only to be told the Hotel was fully aware of the situation and that there really wasnt anything they could do read more,negative,true
The location of the hotel is great right on the river and Michigan Ave Almost everything is within walking distance At the price though and given the 4 star hotel we expected better walls Our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors The sound from both rooms came in loud and clear We heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone he clearly wasnt speaking loudly and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk We asked them to be quiet I shouldnt have expected that to work with some young drunks then called security but they did nothing I was completely annoyed with the noise especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one Unless you are in Chicago to party get drunk and not get any sleep I wouldnt stay here,negative,true
I travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list The room had such a strong odor of smoke it gave me a headache and I used to be a smoker The room service was mediocre and extremely expensive The hotel is disturbingly huge Very difficult to navigate your way around it I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located She curtly gave me crossstreet names and hung up Uhhhhh how do I know which direction to go in??? Stains on the carpet in the room A big gauge in the wall where maybe a thermostat once was??? The shower is decent All in all for the price they charge NO THANKS Im just glad my company is footing the bill,negative,true
I arrived and my friends were already there and visiting a nearby art gallery They put my name on the reservation and told me to get a key from the front desk when I arrived The front desk staff gave me the key to my room and I put my stuff away and went to meet the group We returned late that night and I soon realized the room that my friends were in was not the room that I placed my stuff in that afternoon We went to speak with the front desk We were met with We cant do anything about that right now due to the hour We will not disrupt the guest staying in the room you say you left your stuff in Unacceptable My 1500 laptop and all of the things I brought with me were in that room Not my mistake FINALLY after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes they knocked on the door of the room I had left my belongings in and a lady answered She was upset and stated she had security take the items from her room in the afternoon All of my belongings were recovered in the security room however all of this hullabaloo could have been avoided had they communicated about the situation Terrible terrible customer service They sent up an apology letter champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to the room Although I was appreciative of the gesture it still does not excuse the fact that they argued and continued to say We cant do anything about it,negative,true
Staying here currently Had aspired to sleep The paper thin walls allow even the slightest peep from your neighbor to feel like youre right in bed with them Couldnt sleep anyway because of the cheap giant fluffy pillows Called housekeeping asked for any helpwas simply and accomodatingly told after my plea for help could they would they have any ability to supply me with a reasonable pillow? Complete answer before hanging up We do not Hyatt may your well executed service lead to your demise Happy,negative,true
This hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means Incompetent service Hotel ran out of hot water by 9am saturday Elevators were very slow waited 10 minutes on any given event Red line trains ran every 10 minutes beneath city streets and you can hear the thunder in your room from them but it shouldnt keep you awake at night Used my stay toward NW airlines bonus points Bar was ok One cup coffee service was awful No free wireless and no free cable channels Fridge was 25 bucks a day to use With httphotelscom res got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you expect? Location was superb and cab service was convenient but not enough to outweigh the negatives,negative,true
We had an issue with housekeeping and the hotel management did not handle it well They were subject to a brief staff strike and did not inform guests and in fact failed to tell us about the strike and our room never was cleaned After 4 calls and several hours we were able to get clean towels Overall service other than check in was poor for a reportedly 4 star hotel,negative,true
we love the location and proximity to everything The staff was very friendly and courteous They were so nice to our 25 year old boy got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived We got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program  Cant beat that the only minor issue is the elevator we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often Otherwise it was a great stay,negative,true
The Omni was chosen for its location whichworked out perfectly The bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean untilI sat down in the tubthere was BLACK MOLD in the soap holder in the cracks on the walls between the tile all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl Needless to say I drained the tub and took a showerI really dont care for showers Oh yesthe toilet leaked as wellThe staff were very helpful but I was disappointed I travel extensively and dont think I will return we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel printed the presentation and delivered it to our room They try We booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another buildingbut we werent there too much,negative,true
I have stayed at the Omni off an on over the years On business for personal trips This trip started off quite rocky and left me very unimpressed 1 Be aware they have a new policy where they charge debit card 55 per day for incidentals which you *may* incur They do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card Even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance The desk clerk claimed all the hotels do this nowfunny how when I put a remote employee at the OHare hilton on my business debit card I was never asked for additional funds Having a policy is one thing spreading blame for it is another While not a problem for me someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this policy of theirs To my knowledge they never did this sort of thing before I dont use Credit Cards its why I have money in a recession = 2 Rooms were clean but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list The only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water about 600 ML for 750 As such be careful with the tray of goodies If the water is 750 imagine what the snickers bar might cost 3 Our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken and would not move Calling the front desk resulted in  nothing Finally about 900 PM I elected to have another look at it and it seemed to be off its track I was able to successfully fix it but the lack of response from maintenance considering the rate for a suite is sad I remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive 4 The seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now Overall I think I will be skipping the Omni and they will get no more of my business It seems Hilton treats people better overall Its quite sad as I have a lot of good memories with Omni I will not be back,negative,true
Under the gloss of a nice building friendly staff and a wild set of items in the minibar this is somewhat belowaverage hotel In particular the bed and chairs were some of the least comfortable I ever encountered After two nights my wife and I were practically cripped by bed pain We complained to the staff and were immediately offered the chance to switch to a different room but the other room was furnished identically The owners of the Omni need to stop spending money on bath salts for the rooms and invest in the basic comforts I should not be lying on the floor trying to unkink my back thinking longingly of the last Red Roof Inn I visited,negative,true

We experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel on the Magnificent Mile We never received a return call from General Manager Sanjay Mahajan after several voicemails We will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word We also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel,negative,true
Here are some pros and cons Pros Good location Nice staff Clean room Cons Lack of bathroom amenities I get better items at a Holiday Inn Housekeeping wasnt so great 1 A bathroom rug was taken out of my room no idea why and never returned it The marble floor in the bathroom was very dangerous when slipperyI had to throw towels on the ground to make sure I did not fall 2 I was charged for items I did not take out of the minibar,negative,true
My family booked five nitghts at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming spring break We took advantage of a prepaid noncancellable offer We subsequently received a Bed  Breakfast offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation same dates different offer We called the 800 number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant we simply hung up We had been looking forward to our vacation but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel I should have paid closer attention to the reviews  the Ritz the Four Seasons and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way I will post again after our stay on April 17th,negative,true
I have been meaning to write a review of the Omni but wasnt sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high We stayed here for 5 nights The room was fine when I walked in But about five minutes or so I was all congested Thought it might have been from the flight I then noticed there was dust everywhere The TV the Minibar and worst of all the air vent It was literally hanging off the vent I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up After 30 minutes of waiting and noticing other things A bathroom door that wouldnt close broken light fixtures a toe or fingernail on the bed broken bathroom fixtures This place was a dump Hopefully the pictures will show some of it I could go on and on Almost 90 minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room Both he and head of housekeeping were shocked at the room We were moved to another room not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked or so I was told I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed But this will be the last time Sad to say The hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay but doesnt explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection,negative,true
My family has dubbed the Omni in Chicago Fawlty Towers because there always seems to be something wrong This time our room was right above the kitchen and the odor of cooking grease wafted through our bedroom all night long It smelled like a greasy spoon restaurant and it permeated all of our clothing The bedroom window was bolted shut so we couldnt get any fresh air into the room With the amount that the Omni is charging for a room they should have a much better ventilation system,negative,true
I want to issue a travelwarning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time The deal says free breakfast included in the price However what they dont tell you is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit or two Moreover you need to ask for these tickets at the lobby when you check in  they wont give them to you automatically We stayed there over Christmas 03 and we and I noticed several guests who bought the same package had a rather unpleasant experience The hotel is nice though if you dont consider their lousy service,negative,true
Will start by saying the employees were wonderful especially in the restaurant  bar employees could not have been nicerwhat appeared to be the hotel manager went above and beyondUnfortunately thats where it ends The rooms in my opinion appeared different then pictures and were worn and rattyyou know uninviting sofa and crappy coffee table and desk area the first room I was given had bright construction lights shining in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my windowI kid you not they seemed as if they were about 1520 ft from my window And this was after I specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent viewI was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly again just worn outNOT a 4 star hotel this seemed to be closer to a 2 perhaps being extremely kind 3 starI travel on business so I know the differenceI merely touched the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand I complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit she made sure the door was fixed ASAP They gave me a bottle of wine to compensatewhich I utilized to dull my senses as to my surroundings for the next 2 daysI wanted to give Omni a shotbig mistake Unfortunately brought a friend with me to show her how great Chicago was and I was soooo embarrassed as I had chosen the hotelShe was extremely disappointed as wellshould have gone with my first instinct which was the Conrad Lesson learned,negative,true
No excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner I wouldnt expect a cold shower at a budget hotel let alone an Omni Great location and the bar is nice,negative,true
Complete disappointment Problems 1 The alarm clockstereo thing was broken in my room It was constantly emitting low changing hissing noises Sooo annoying And there was no off switch on the damn thing I had to move the bed to unplug it the outlet was wayyy back buried behind the big bed I kept hearing it and didnt realize what it was until it had kept me awake for a few hours 2 The shower was ONLY incredibly hot Turn it all the way coldvery hot Turn it to hot and you get boiling hot Grrrrreat So how do I get water that wont scald me? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water Good job Omni 3 Hallway carpets are disgusting and old Walking around youd think youre in a motel 6 And my floor had been flooded or something and they had box fans running in the hallway 247 to try to dry it out Talk about an overpriced dump,negative,true
Nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the Omni Location was great but there are a lot of other options If you get a really good deal on the room I wouldnt say no,negative,true
My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool one white phone and one emergency red phone to call the desk Both were out of service I am glad there wasnt an emergency As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean never heard back,negative,true
Not a good start when the front desk isnt willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room We reserved a King Suite and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch he offered us a free breakfast but would not upgrade our room The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni We will not be retuning to this Hotel again,negative,true

My son  I joined my husband on a work trip We planned to swim while he was working We overheard a lady asking when the pool would open as as we were checking in Though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at 630 pm We gave up  went out for the evening We had a very noisy sleepless night We werent facing MI ave but still heard sirens and Im not sure what the other noise was but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about 20x an hour throughout the entire night I called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open so my very excited son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction Upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crews actions  on my insistence she said shed look into it A gentleman called back an hour later  said the pool should open at 5pmit was 9am It is now 6pm  we still havent even seen the pool We check out tomorrow We passed up time with grandparents who are in for the holiday to swim in Chicago Needless to say we are VERY disappointed,negative,true

Stayed for a week last month Cant beat the location  close to the Magnificent Mile Attractions Tours Great Restaurants  Night Life Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels Thought the room was ok not great Overpriced in my opinion Found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less Watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well Breakfast was the same stuff day after day As the week went on they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished weekly delivery I guess Also the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant Travel for work sales and frequently stay in hotels Travel with family every year and also stay in hotels This is roughing it for menot a camper Would come to Chicago again but would not stay here There are too many other options worth investigating,negative,true
Upon first entering the hotel we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered Through our 2 week stay they told us to have a nice day as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return Breakfast is served in the AM and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen It was a very enjoyable stay,negative,true
WARNING FOOD POISONING ALERT The room was dirty the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on The elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it They hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for What was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick The one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue The second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer DO NOT STAY HERE,negative,true
Ideal location right in the heart of the Near North side but good grief they need more than two elevators You can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor registration desk on 6th floor you can face a long line just to catch one Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites  very utilitarian unlike many locations however this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms The pool is OK but theres no jacuzzi Oh and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area Front desk service is pretty good,negative,true
My fiance and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay The rest of the staff however was terrible When we first checked in I was instantly discouraged The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldnt wait to leave the lobby Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff At one point the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well Even though she saw us standing there after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first Yes we are in our mid 20s but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible For how much money we paid for each night I would have rather stayed somewhere else We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews but we did not experience any of this during our stay The rooms were alright but nothing special I would not stay in this hotel again,negative,true
This hotel is trading on the Hilton name and although adequate the decor is dated and depressing Although classed as a three star the prices do not reflect this It was more expensive than other four star hotels in the neighbourhood The breakfast is poor quality and the room very crowded All in all the worst hotel we stayed at in a 14 day tour of Canada and the USA Would not stay there again,negative,true
While the parking service was great  the front desk was terrible We had a huge problem getting ice one night  we had none in our room so we went twice to get some  no one was there to help called the front desk they promised to deliver some  none arrived so we called again  they said we had to come and get it and would not listen to what we had to say about what had already happened read more,negative,true
Even though the reviews of this hotel are very good the only good thing about it is the Location which is excelent aside from that there are only 2 elevators so there is ALWAYS a wait to get in they also seem to have insufficient staff so getting your luggage room service etc takes forever even if you arrive in a cab there is no space to loadunload so you have to block the street while you arrivedepart the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a refresh all in all there are much better options in Chicago,negative,true
I called the reservations line to book a room at the beginning of December 2012 for a rate with a local corporation When I first made the reservation I did not get an email confirmation I had to call again to get the email and then saw that I was booked in a handicapped accessible room which i did not need as there was me my wife and three year old I called the reservation line and asked for a regular room which they said was impossible at the rate I was at however for ten dollars more I can upgrade to a regular room I then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me i told them to cancel the room based on the reservation experience I did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel,negative,true
I choose the Homewood Suites in Downtown Chicago because I called them directly in search of a two bed room within walking distances of the attractions of Chicago Well when we arrived it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service which it had been since Tuesday this was Saturday Once we finally got to the 6th floor to check in I figured our relaxing time had begun Well we got our room key and headed for the17th floor Again waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room I put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room  Yup we got double booked The family was very nice and seemed OK with their surprise visitors Said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out We have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed Made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation I did get an apology and a new room New key in hand waited AGAIN for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room FINALLY got to our room only to find it was a king suite We are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys There was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa So REALLY annoyed now I called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though I had specifically asked for two beds when I booked It said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when I checked in She went so far to but TWO BEDS on my reservation paper work The operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor The only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area Now I paid a total of 34900 for one night for this room We got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal I am pretty sure my next trip to Chicago will not include this hotel I can tell you that we are frequent HWSHilton customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future,negative,true
This review has two parts  I advise reading both Chapter One The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating The room was nice and clean as well I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North Very easy one block walk from the subway Red line The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial Not just muffins and coffee You can have a complete breakfast here if you want And even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location the room and the staff Chapter Two The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a midSeptember arrival The rate was quoted to me as 159 per night for four nights When the confirmation was emailed to me it was incorrect by over 300 I immediately called the hotel They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount I did receive the corrected confirmation email  All done? NO One week later my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve When I explained the error I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations and told Thats not my problem I cant help you   and then told that I have to pay the higher amount Excuse ME? Now I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance After a few left messages I get the general manager to call me back and discuss the issue After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with he assures me that he will credit the account immediately I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc   One week later still no credit So I call the general manager again Oh this might take up to 72 hours to process I am told So please give it another week Another week passes still no credit So another call to the manager I am told now that the credit HAS been processed and he even sends me an email confirming our agreement for the credit just to appease me Another week passes Still not seeing that credit that was definitely processed a week ago Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago I told him I will be arriving and at this point I want to see him personally and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there Remember we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved I arrive at the hotel and to make a long story short the general manager was NEVER available to see me nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me The only person I spoke face to face with was the assistant general manager He was completely unconcerned with my situation and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of you realize this boils down to a matter of he said she said   WHAT???? Today my trip is over and I have flown back home I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point Take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel,negative,true
While it was a nice hotel but i am rather frustrated with them During our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping The first day was fine Second day my diamond earrings came up missing Noticed they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process My biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further But we had a family reunion and funeral to get to While the front desk was great and said they would handle it I believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way We filed a police report and the GM of the hotel is supposed to be working on it We have called several times but receive no answers They keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 + yearsthat dosent matter to me If they are not held accountable whats to stop them from taking anything There is a dishwasher in the room and they found my daughters ring which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings in the dishwasher They say I put the cup in the dishwasher First I am on vacation trust me im NOT doing dishes Second why would I wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room? So while it is a nice hotellock up your things of value They may come up missing and youll be left frustrated,negative,true
I called on December 6th 2010 at 3 pm to book a room for an upcoming weekend getaway and was taken aback when the phone was picked up and promptly hung up without a word Thinking this might have been a simple mistake I gave it another try A woman introducing herself as Toni answered the phone rushed through her introduction sounding incredibly bored and annoyed that she had to answer the phone Barely letting a second go by after her introduction she gave a snotty Hello? before I could open my mouth and tell her Never mind Never has a hotel answered my call so rudely Id like to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and pin this unpleasant experience to Toni however I will not be calling back again in hopes to stay at this hotel during this trip,negative,true
The lobby of the Homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining roomactually more of a grade school cafeteria type set up The odors from the kitchen were disgusting and indeed reminded my of that of a institutional kitchenIe hospital The free breakfast and free dinner were not at all palatable I suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were that makes this hotel a good value But i would not stay here again,negative,true
I booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the Magnificent Mile Christmas Lights Parade I chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed We arrived at our hotel around 330 PM to check in We came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 300 PM After giving him our name the manager saidOK we have your king smoking suite available We quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a nonsmoking room He insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room We went back and forth then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation Luckily we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone It clearly said nonsmoking After showing him our reservation he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available So why in the world did he need to see our reservation We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room It turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children The manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed We canceled our room reservation We live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home My family was very disappointed My husband is a gold member with Hilton Lets just say we will be switching back to Marriott The hotel lobby was dated The smoking room that I saw looked very dated as well They made an error and never owned up to it nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience,negative,true
I booked this hotel on Priceline for 413 and a week later called the hotel directly to add 412 to our stay The receptionist confirmed my reservation confirmation# and gave me a lower rate for both nights for the same king suite When we arrived at checkin there was no record of my 412 reservation whatsoever The hotel was also fully booked leaving my tired hungry family and I high and dry with nowhere to go The only decent thing that happened with this whole debacle was that Lisa at the checkin desk called around to several other hotels closeby to find us a room and seemed to be the only employee working at a very busy time of evening We ended up at Embassy Suites for both nights and had a very pleasant experience there,negative,true
We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast  get a quick bite then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff Well our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly and thankfully switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights The room was dirty When we opened the sofabed the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used and theoretically cleaned a lot Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms werent much better Temperature control in the room was imprecise  minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night it made for a cold stay If you like to eat for free they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights and dont care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer I guess some may find this place tolerable But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area we switched to The James and had a great experience I couldnt be paid to stay here again Im shocked by the high overall rating given our experience,negative,true
After reading good reviews about I booked a 5 night stay Checked in late bit called early in the day to assure wed have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for 2 teens They somehow had us booked for two rooms instead Got that sorted out and arrived around 10 pm Checked in and waited for our luggage Finally went down and got it ourselves The room was a little grungy furniture shabby and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover Ewww Called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me FYI its kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel Next day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron didnt work Called for a replacement waited a while called again and was brought another iron which also didnt work Third time was a charm Oh boy Too bad we paid in advance Wont be staying here again,negative,true
This hotel had a great location but you can do much better for the money The hallways smelled of smoke dirty elevators furniture in the lobby was thread bare The staff was very helpful The room was large bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered If you have any allergies dont stay here,negative,true
We went to Chicago for my 2nd wedding anniversary and stayed at Homewood My first impression was great very helpful valet employees and VERY nice That is one perk of my stay here Otherwise we had no problems checking in other than the hotel has 19 floors and when we booked the room we asked that we have the highest room avalible due to the fact that it was my husband first time there and the higher up the more beautiful the view is So we got the 9th floor Not what I call high up when the rooms started on floor 6 Then the following morning we went to breakfast of which was ok nothing great My husband and I went down in jeans and a sweatshirt but had not really thought about shoes as we thought it would just be a few bagles some fruit and that was it So we got our food and sat down After getting stared at for the first 1520 minutes an employee came and told us that we wernt allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on Remind you it was about 1520 minutes after we had even entered the room So she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast Pretty pointless AFTER we already had gotten our food I am sure it is because very few employees could speak understandable english that it took so long Last but not least dont come with a clean car I had washed my car one day prior to arriving there and when it was returned it was filthy dirty,negative,true
We booked thru hotwire which we have a high percentage of positive outcomes I was very happy when we saw that we would be staying at The Knickerbockeras I had stayed when I was younger We reserved a King NonSmoker Upon arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a Smoking room When argued they stated well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority As we entered the room I noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on We called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light Later that eveing as I took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels Also I must add the room reaked of smoke The next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems he told us the total and had not concern of our issues We also checked in our bags for the day and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day We realized a bit later that we forgot something in one of the bags and was told they would not get them back out STAY AWAYeven if you get a good deal,negative,true
Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal First a member of the staff entered our room midday unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present Not a tremendous problem but when the young woman at the front desk replied What do you want me to do about it with the tone of a flippant teenager I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff Fast forward to this evening Following a lovely meal off the premises we chose to turn in a bit early at 1130 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room Acting prudently and with restraint we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume On one hand I appreciated his honesty but on the other I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property Since were out of options for the evening weve decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being but given the circumstances the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession Also I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night a possible gangrelated shooting took place mere blocks from the property This wouldnt have been a concern if like nearby hotels the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby Would I stay here again? Maybe on a dare or if someone else was footing the bill Yet Ive had better experiences in road side motels and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests and more importantly simple common sense,negative,true
Location is excellent but dont valet your car there5300 a day Bed was to soft pillows were flat we couldnt open up the mini bar cabinet because the bed was in the way All in all not what youd expect from a hotel in that area,negative,true
We booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on Priceline paid 85 which thought was good price for a 4* in downtown Chicago The location is great The hotel minimally OK> Unsure how it gets a 4* rating It is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift Staff were pleasant and overall it was a good stay However I would NOT recommend this hotel I would rather have paid 100 and got something more updated  trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case My suggestion DO NOT BOOK PRICELINE FOR CHICAGO IL AND ASK FOR 4 * BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO GETNOT GOOD ENOUGH PRICELINE IN MY OPINION,negative,true
Just returned from a one night stay at the Knickerbocker and I will not return It came nowhere near being worth the price I paid Hotel Burnham is twice the hotel at half the price The bathroom was unbelieveably small and smelled terribly We had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered which frankly may as well have been paper towels nothing plush about them at all We didnt have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered Room service cart was left outside our door all night All in all it was a very disappointing stay The only redeeming quality of this hotel seems to be its location And for me its just not worth it,negative,true
Rude rude rude We stayed here on July 4th weekend We drove from Michigan we called customer service to get directions from I95 wc is a major highway to Chicago calling them from a cellphone telling them were in a middle of a storm and that were lostwe were put on hold forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again Giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 711 store When we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves Checking in we were not greeted by anyone even the receptionist did not greet us no welcome to the knickerbocker nothing The man at the reception was rude which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has The guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checkingin at 2 am Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier The room is not even spectacular very small probably a little bigger than a walkin closet Stay here at your own risk,negative,true
I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in midMarch and was so disappointed with everything The room was small the carpets in the looby were smelly no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows Not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days It costs 10day to connect to internet If you want to use internet in the lobby minimum charge is 5 per use To use the phone in the rooms for local calls it is 12515mins and then 10 cents every min Even the local calls are charged what a rip off Every hotel I have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast of course no such thing at this hotel No indoor pool go figure I won this from bidding process at priceline I will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future,negative,true
While this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing I would not recommend this hotel to anyone The rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel ever The crown molding and base boards are cracked and it appears to only have been painted over and over again The newer tub liner in the bathroom is merely floating above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it bubbles under your feet The shower tiles are old and the grout is not clean This hotel has not been restored the updating that has been done are merely bandaides There is no fan exhaust in the bathroom and the carpet is ontop of a very hard surface probaly concrete with no pad in between The lobby is smokey because of the large open bar in the small space We were in town on business and supposed to stay 4 nights we left after 2 and went to another hotel,negative,true
I booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor After booking the hotel room I contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds I was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that I would have a room with 2 double beds When I arrived I was given a King sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests Apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed The staff was completely unaccomodating To add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in I would not recommend this hotel to anyone The customer service is well below what is acceptable The location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting Chicago Bottom line is do NOT stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker,negative,true
I stayed here for 5 nights last summer I booked the reservation on priceline for 75night which was the cheapest rate I could find anywhere during a convention week Anyway when I arrived at 11 pm from the airport I was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me They booked me at a dumpy 2 star motel by the airport They gave me 20 for a taxi to get there and it cost me 35 I was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packingunpacking The Millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foulup No free drink no room upgrade nothing Since I booked on the internet I was chopped liver Beware,negative,true
We stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business part family fun trip in July We were very impressed with the location within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping inlcuding Water Tower Place a great mall We were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size The bedspreads were filthy and so thin The room decor is in dire need of an upgreade The bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew The shower actually had mold in the corners This was a very tight squeese for 4 people Especially the bathroom The beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable Even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit 6 people Thank goodness there were a few elevators Luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price The only upside was the great location Also beware its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle Millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab,negative,true
The location of this hotel is excellent The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say  in my opinion The room decor is horrible probably more European than I am used to and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment On the upside if you want to stay in a great location feel safe and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work I prefer Westin or Marriottsomething that you can count on,negative,true
The hotel lost our reservations and then couldint accommodate what we needed they gave us a room much smaller than we needed and when we requested something diffrerent they were unable to fulfill our request we opted to leave the hotel and after there mistake of losing our reservations they still charged us an early check out fee If it wasnt for the great location of the hotel there would be nothing positive to say,negative,true
This hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years The first room they gave us was a shock TINY and the bathroom was a joke you had to step inside move out of the way just to shut the door The furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times so they transfered us to the executive suite That room had a tiny bathroom I mean TINY The furniture was hideous and dirty It was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud The only impressive part is the lobby but dont be fooled because after that  the floors above look like they need a major overhaul and the rooms were not worth even 100 per night we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal I dont think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we dont ever want to go back there again 2 Stars at best for the dumpy Knickerbocker They should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms Boomer Naperville IL,negative,true
From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel It took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty Another person perhaps the manager was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew The hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floorsespecially when 1 of the 3 breaks as seems to be frequent occurence After specifically asking for a room away from the elevators I was assigned to a room directly across from them necessitating another 20 minute wait in line The room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night I requested a news paper be delivered to my room  it appeared on the morning and never again Basically the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained Never again ,negative,true
This place is a dump I booked on Priceline because the last time I booked a Priceline hotel in Chicago I got the Westin and loved it Despite having paid for Priceline I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend instead I didnt regret it for a second You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more The location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive There are enough hotels near the loop and near a trainbus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively that you should not spend the money on the Millenium Do not waste your time and stay herethis is a trap because of its location but its not worth it Really,negative,true
Before booking this hotel I did read the reviews and I was concerned I ended up booking it based on my sisters recommendation BIG MISTAKE The temperature in Chicago was a balmy 99 degrees and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees When we called to complain at 1100 am they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees We went back at 730pm it was still humid the beds were moist  the room very stuffy Called again they sent somone to fix it  he recommended getting a new room because the room will not cool down They told us they were booked yet after the maintenance man called they suddenly had a room available go figure? So they move us to another room guess what it is 85 degrees Again they told us to turn it down to 40 needless to say it never cooled down  we should have just slept on the street We travel a lot and we stayed here one night and it was awful At check out I had to retell our entire room issue they actually ended up not charging us for the night thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay because we would never go back Also the room decor is very old and stuffy If your going to Chicago dont stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker,negative,true
The historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel Unfortunately the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings The front desk staff was rude the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door There are three elevators but good luck with them all working They are very very small and when only one is up and runningyou end up waiting a long time for one Not fun when you are on the 12th floor The room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at allthe room felt damp and miserable We put the thermostat as low as it would let us 65 and the room never went below 78 and it was 107 outside the whole trip There really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant Internet is not free either Overall I would never stay here again,negative,true
The aircondition has a noisy fancompressor in each room It starts every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up At least the first night This is an old fashion system that needs to be replaced The postal service at the hotel is nonworking The hotel messed up our concert tickets that was correctly addressed and transported by UPS The tickets were at the Hotel General Managers office The reception denied that they had arrived We had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it The Hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience The concert was the reason for our travel to Chicago Else the Hotel had good standard free internet in the lobby not to good view from the rooms and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars We had booked 20 roomnights all together staying at room 612 425 and 431 from the 23rd June,negative,true
I unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the Knickerbocker Hotel I should have checked out on day 1 The bathrooms were filthy dirty with tangled hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of scratching and the feeling of skin crawlingI pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheetsbed bugs Which I might add the hotel are saying are flying insects from the windows being left open from when the window cleaners were there fortunately I took photos to the contrary Finding the bed bugsI looked at the mattress protector and pillows and found long hairs on bothI was disgusted at the hygeine and would never stay again at this establishment,negative,true
We stayed at this hotel for a conference The lobby and the conference areas were immaculate The restaurants one of which was Shulas Steakhouse and bars were great The saff was exteremely helpful The rooms left a lot to be desiredOur nonsmoking room smelled of smoke The AC system was ancient and tempermental and the bathroom was old and in need of a makeover It was surprising to see since the physical plant was so nice We would choose however to stay elsewhere Espcially for the money we paid,negative,true
I was in Chicago for a convention and stayed at the Sheraton towers I had a negative experience because I got about one dozen very painful bites by bed bugs on my torso It made attending the conference uncomfortable The staff changed the sheets but could not move me to another room as the conference had booked the whole hotel After the sheets were changed I got no more bites thankfully Despite this I managed to enjoy the stay I liked the location next to the river and the fact that it was easy to walk to Magnificent Mile,negative,true
We had reservations guaranteed by credit card for 2 nights this past weekend When we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town I asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning They sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us The night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way Eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the Sheraton for the transfer  something we were never given Eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys didnt work we found out that the night manager of the Sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel So once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the Sheraton In addition to all of this we had to pay 24 for parking at the Sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation I am still shocked by this bad experience,negative,true
Two main issues 1 understaffed from the street to the front desk Unfortunately I had to drive into the city when I arrived there was an excessively long wait for parking Then inside there was a huge queue line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel Not good I will say friendly however 2 I know this is a big city but 49 a night to park my car when Im staying at that hotel? Really?? Thats unreasonable and a bit gouging in my opinion Again I realize this is Chicago but Im already paying a hefty price for this outdated hotel,negative,true
Stayed in April for two nights I hesitated selecting the Sheraton becaue I had a very poor stay there earlier this year As far as Im concerned thats two strikes and I wont give them a chance at # three Doormen wouldnt help on arrival huge line at ci lousy room malfunctioning remote unresponsive staff and incorrect bill If you want to be close to Michigan Ave try the Westin or Intercontinental and spare yourself the problems I dont understand why certain places never improve Is it that tough to properly train a staff?,negative,true
I recently stayed at the Sheraton for an onsite conference and had problems from the getgo I had problems with the checkin even though I had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file The front desk clerks were kind of rude The room was okay not worth what I paid for The sheets were kind of messed up and the room didnt feel very clean They also charge for internet access which is ridiculous Most hotels provide free wifi The conference food which I assume is catered by the hotel was not good at all On the day of the check out I had arranged for a late checkout but in the morning before checkout time someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time All in all I would recommend staying somewhere else,negative,true
As a frequent traveler for work I stay at many SPG properties Compared to all the SPG property in Chicago this is by far the worst Why? 1 They charge you to use the gym 12 per day or something like 24 for your entire stay I cant even begin on what a rip off that is 2 As a Gold or Platinum member you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room They do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one 3 They do not have wireless internet It is 2010 enough said To charge you at least over 200 a night all the above amenities should be built into that cost I would never stay here again,negative,true
Firtly they took 372 off my card even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night They had no business taking the money off of my card So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel When I looked a week later they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate so two of my friends didnt come to the trip away Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound After about 8 phone calls over 5 months each saying they would they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150 Overall the hotel was nice and in a nice location but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems,negative,true
great bed but when I first came in I requested a room with a lake view i requested this over the phone as well and the front desk woman said this is a great room I go upstairs and its awful looking The view was of the neighboring roofs Then I spent half an hour trying to find a better room Eventually I got a corner roof with a partial view Horrible experience also rooms were small and had crappy look yellowy wallpaper and bedsheets,negative,true
Generally speaking nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue We checked the closed with the mini bar picture uploaded so much dust nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years We called in housekeeping giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it Still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs later Next day moved to a renovated room much better but not 5 star clean at all In addition there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception no wonder when just 13 of the counters is actually open Please do something about these issues its ruining everything,negative,true
All I can say is avoid this place at all costs From the reservations assistant who took 45 minutes to book a room to check out they billed my card for 750 dollars and getting a refund numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call AVOID AVOID AVOID a truely hideous experieince I will never stay at a Starwood resort again and given I stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement,negative,true
Truly a tattered run down facility that you should avoid  Rooms are small dirty and in no way represents the web sites representations Staff is poorly trained and a very big disappointment At best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in Chicago please avoid this one I had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms,negative,true
Was there recently for one night for a conference Tried to checkin at 530pm the published checkin was 3pm they said my room wasnt ready where as others coming after me were assigned rooms Was given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready I chilled there until 8pm no call so went out for dinner Came back at 930pm and asked if my room was ready The gal said of course yes and give me a key When asked why no one called me she just shrugged No my troubles did not end there I went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room Came back to the lobby then they apologized and gave me another room I said I was not going to walkin on somebody else again so they sent someone with me to open the new room For all my trouble they reduced my bill by about 40% It was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru Very bad experience,negative,true
We stayed here for one night and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest We found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this  @ 200 for the night We felt when we checked in that if you werent with the conference then why were we staying in the hotel The guy at the main door didnt even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby we then had to que for 1520 minutes just to check in We were not given any information about the hotel and when I rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that I could access the Internet through I was just short of being asked why didnt I bring my laptop with me so I could use the Internet access in the room  I found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist,negative,true
Negative points 1 I guess they gave me the worst room Its small room with a king size bed even though Id requested a room with two queen beds 2 No roll away bed was available so I had to sleep on the floor 3 The tub in the bathroom would not drain 4 No exhaust fan in the bathroom 5 broken furniture Plus point 1 Convenient location,negative,true
I have traveled to Chicago many times for business and so I have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons There was nothing dramatically wrong the Sheraton but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel It almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs The carpets were old there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom towels and linens were older than I expected the rooms were in need of some redecorating etc during the week I was paying 349 per night for a room and it simply was not near the quality I expected for that price One positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good Plenty of aerobic machines with TVs weights etc location is also quite good perhaps the reason for the high price with close walks to Michigan Avenue and the river In summary I think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown Chicago,negative,true
My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience The location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel Everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere I dont necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere The poolspaexcercise room was not very impressive either It is accessible by walking through the business center corridor wondering if youre going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small There is also no hot tub and the spa is a closet with a massage table The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the sheraton promise phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors The beds were super comfortable I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago,negative,true
After staying at the Sheraton Royal Orchid Hotel in Bangkok I was expecting a similar experience at the Chicago Sheraton I had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience Unfortunately my expectations were not met For the past 3 years I stayed at the Palmer House in the Loop but thought Id try a more modern hotel PROS  location by the Chicago River two blocks from Michigan Avenue  restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment  buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes crepes and french toast CONS  checkin assigned me to a city view room when I had prepaid for a river view room  river view was good but the windows to see it were filthy  dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door  bathroom was unimpressive bathtubshower combination worn plumbing fixtures only 2 sets of towels provided  guest room was small only one soft chair provided  guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway  7 to 8 block walk to nearest Lstation  concierge couldnt explain how to get to the Mercury Theatre nor print a map of the area  guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get Starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the Link Cafe  no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room  no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before checkout  not all computers were operational at the Link Cafe where boarding passes can be printed,negative,true
We booked our hotel stay thru Yahoo and requested a room for 4 with 2 beds When we got to the hotel not only did they not have a room for us we prepaid but they said they could not guarantee what we had requested online they could only give us what was available The hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after I got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us If you book online  beware You may not get what you paid for They did not stand by their promise they advertise in each room,negative,true
I stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held On the plus side the hotel is reasonably well located within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue My room had a superb view out over the river However for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment The decor was dated and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty The wifi is ridiculously expensive and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access There was no wifi in the conference rooms although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails I know Chicago is expensive but for that price I feel the experience should have been better,negative,true
We travel to Chicago frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels downtown We were excited to try the Swissotel but left disappointed The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views the staff was extremely rude The man that checked us in was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until he was done with his phone call He then did not say more than five words which were I need a credit card The lobby bar had fireplaces and was very cozy The hotel information said it closed at 2am so we came back to hotel at 1230am for a night cap that was last call That was fine for us but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a night cap but did not make last call Our night ended listening to many unhappy people complaining and receiving no sympathy from the employees There are many places to stay in the area that are just as nice or nicer no need to stay at the Swissotel again Definitely dont stay if youre looking for a romantic weekend away the employees will ruin your experience from the second you walk in the door,negative,true
The hotel is staffed by very nice but many inexperienced people Executive lounge has limited hours and no access outside of those hours Other areas similarly lack the level of service that is expected for this type of hotel One of the individuals at the concierge desk twice gave us bad information about public transportation and the hours at one place While the location is good this particular hotel is simply not a good representation of what Swissotel is supposed to be and there are far better choices in Chicago It would not be my choice for a return stay,negative,true
My wife and I frequently stay downtown for a night in the city We have been to many hotels in the downtown Chicago area My opinion of the Swissotel  spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience The Swissotel has a very cold atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable The room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average The view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel Other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more Our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 800a which woke us up We called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk We also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel They said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register He didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment Overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service Anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area,negative,true
I just had a conference there They have bed bugsI have all these bug bites and it itches like hell Food wise we had chicken BOTH times for lunch maybe my company was saving some  but they should at least prepare them differently It looked like they did the same style chicken but change the underlying bed upon which it is served For dinner we had filet mignon and crab cake Sounds good right? Wrong The filet mignon seems to be 12 the thickness of what I have seen and it was tough I thought the filet mignon is suppose to be tenderest part of the cow???? Also the crab cakes was a bit too salty Finally the portions were tiny and left me lacking In asking my coworker most seem to be blase about the food However some seem to like the burger which they went to substitute at the Palms which is a restaurant inside the hotel just off the lobby On the positive note the dessert for dinner was good Otherwise Id recommend another hotel In the meantime when I got home I make sure to bring EVERYTHING straight to the washerdryer to disinfect even strip down But damn Im still itchin,negative,true
Three nights there on business Hadnt realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement very bleak Told the front desk that I hadnt realized about the construction so Id have to switch hotels they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights So I stayed TV didnt work Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored meeventually after I called again a few hours later a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it Long and complicated experience at the business center which doesnt open until 9am BTW where I ended up paying 45 to print 55 pages Had to buy these cards and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway and charging me for them I was left with 22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago 2000 miles from where I live I asked for a refund on the card and  no surprise  she declined to help me with that Nice room nice view but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad Worst experience Ive ever had at a hotel when traveling for business,negative,true
I would NOT recommend staying at the Swissotel in Chicago I was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times She had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since I would be arriving first The night manager at the hotel was extremely rude and told me I could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation this was THEIR mistake They told me I could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived They did nothing to try and help me until I stood there and complained for twenty minutes I cant believe that a manager would treat a customer this way There are other great hotels in Chicago This hotel is not worth the aggravation,negative,true
The elevator system was impossible It seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse Many people waited 15+ minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells It happened several times I had read about it before booking but guess I didnt take it seriously Itd be a deal breaker for any future return unless I heard clearly it was improved Also I always think its lame that you have to pay extra for WiFi Area recommendations North Michigan Avenue and Lake front areas are best,negative,true
Over all my trip was great I got to spend time with my best friend We did some shopping and site seeing Trip was overall great The only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels I have stayed at Some of the walls had wall paper missing most of the faucets leaked there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms some of the furniture had very visible stains the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom we stayed in the corner suite on the 37 floor room 3711 Considering what ones pays for the room you would think the pool would be free and they would not charge for every single small amenity I do not plan on staying there again Apart from the trip was great[],negative,true
Very Very noisy  Constant water running through pipes It was terrible There are much better hotels to stay at in Chicago Thier parking rate is obnoxious 4200 a night and way too far out to walk to much If you must stay here try to park for free on dead end street feed meter on weekdays and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a Jewel grocery store for sodassnacks A can of soda at the hotel was 450 plus 18% restocking fee,negative,true
Stayed valentines weekend Got the 5th floor with a direct view of the building next door You have to pay extra for the pool and the ice machine was out on our floor Parking nearby sucks as most of Chicago or pay 50 for valet to go through your car Glasses were dusty and gross This location is notorious for having super sensitive scales on the mini fridge so when you barely touch it youll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door Had I been on a higher floor and had a better view it would be a 4 star but not this time,negative,true
We stayed at the Swissotel for a three day weekend and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived Is it just me or is this information not clearly stated on their website? A giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming The room itself was fine More bland and generic than the European elegance claimed on their website The lack of hot water was definitely not fine though There were a couple pluses to our stay at Swissotel The location is good the bed was comfortable and the room was clean These few good points certainly did not redeem our experience and I wouldnt pick this place again even postconstruction,negative,true
Was one of the worst travel experiences of quite some time 1 Arrived to construction or renovation to main lobby no warning not on the website thanks for letting me make the choice to stay in hotel with construction site 2 Lengthy line to wait at makeshift reception area 25 min wait check inACHE conference be prepared for the influx of people for the convention 3 Double book room go back to check in told to get back in line and we will review when it is your turn told them I just waited 25 mins Curt service worker said wait your turn 4 Second room dirty dishes from room service in front of door at our check in at 3PM 5 Internet kept dropping and slower than dial up network 6 Second day and Third day stay No hot Water to start the day off with cold shower 7 Check out overcharge on bogus fees Travel to Chicago stay at the Palmer House or Fairmont,negative,true
Swisses Chicago Nice but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the Chicago waterfront A spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city but dont plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning No free WiFi here or affordable breakfast or a free swim in the pool Just a tendollaranight charge for internet an on average 25 plate for breakfast and another 15 bucks a night for the fitness center Ive stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room Get with it  this is 2009 No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and dont need it anyway but for those of us who arent charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated Coffee milk OJ stale donuts muffins maybe some cereal Throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby With regards to swimming this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly This all makes the 6 Fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain Summation Drop the fees the nickel dimming of folks and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel,negative,true
Wow Here is a place to NEVER hold an event First no one smiles including the bartenders Doesnt anyone here know they are in the HOSPITALITY business? The bartender was 54 years old Why do I know that? Because she stated to another employee that when you get to be 54 years old you tell it like it is Very specifically she was referring to the fact that she could tell her employers how they should run things Wow The room was set up the wrong way for the event The food was just plain bad 9 at a Ponderosa would have been as good However this is the Swisshotel Oh lets go back to the bartender telling us unsolicited about all the problems with the hotel Man you just have to wonder how a place like this stays in business 50 for valet Ouch Anyone asking you if you need something like help? No Does management make excuses? You bet Do you ever want to hold an event here? Big no,negative,true
Just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the Swissotel Chicago is the one for you My wife and I went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door this year there is a loud construction site next door So 8 am Saturday morning you will hear the workers starting I am sure once the summer in Chicago comes around they will work all night Just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the Navy Pier Now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete On top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own The front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was The protestors were there because the Swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers If you ask the workers about the noise and they say we cant hear it I am sure the Swissotel does not want word getting out about this If you insist on trying it for yourself dont pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck,negative,true
The room was big and luxurious befitting the price tag 299 Bed was very comfortable However my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft and I heard the elevators running all night Also held a oneday conference there for 25 people They stuck us in a long narrow room that was cramped Also the night before we had a preconference dinner at the Palm restaurant in the hotel Service was so slow that some of our party left before entrees were served And the steaks were only soso a far cry from my experience with other Palms,negative,true
Swissotel continues to be a *yawn* As previous posters state punching in your floor is ridiculous On the other hand technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me why change? In any case I want to take a nice hot soak andguess whatthey are having water problems SOOOOO disappointed Hopefully I dont get bug bitten this time checked under the sheets Sadly due to my companys deal I think I have to stay here again next year *sigh*but so far they are batting 1 star  Oh boy it must be my luckor rather this hotel is just run down I had to swap room FOUR TIMES And thats for a Thurs niteSunday morning stay My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms They gave me the key to the 2nd room which happened to be occupied Luckily the occupants had their security latch on so there wasnt any embarrassing moment My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today just now I had to move because of water leakage above my room and below my room BOY talk about an awful hotel or my just awful luck???? Maybe its karma since I wrote a bad review last year and continue to write onebut its the TRUTH Oh also last year may not have been bed bugs I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I STILL get these itchy patches on my leg Perhaps it is something in the sheetsor the airHVAC in any case despite the decent staff it is a ONE at best 0 for hotel 1 for the still nice servicesince its not their fault All I can say is THANK GOODNESS MY COMPANY WONT HOLD THE CONFERENCE IN CHICAGO NEXT YEAR or AT LEAST AT THIS HOTEL,negative,true
My husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night I called the hotel and spoke with Eric he quickly canceled my reservation and i asked if we would be charged for thd cancellation he said no and that was the end of it My husband then remembered we needed to cancel from bookitcom as well I called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement I informed courtney from bookitcom that i specifically asked if we would be charged and i was told no by Eric She spoke with the mgr Erica and she said Erica would honor that if i could provide a name I got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he didnt recall saying that I was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied He said no maam i dont remember saying that I said so since you dont remember thats it??? I said my husband heard him say it bc he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there I asked to speak to Erica told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on I asked him nicely to please tell the truth and he just would not tell thr truth I have never writte A review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this Erica was very unprofessional and cared more about not taking sides than she did about making sure the guests feel welcome VERY DISAPPOINTED WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN,negative,true
The Swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere It was clean comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to checkin use the concierge checkout or report a problem to the front desk forget about it I booked this place through PricelineCOM so I cant complain too much as I didnt pay a lot for the room but I have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another Swissotel It left a lot to be desired The minibar fridge in my room didnt work so forget about a cold beer Also the internetmovieguest services console didnt work so I had to go to the business office to access the internet When it was time to checkout the console still wasnt working Its better than the Holiday Inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel,negative,true
Overall I had a VERY Bad experience when hosting a meeting for company but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the Swissotel I thought we should give them another try Turns out my first impression was correct this is the LEAST friendly hotel Ive ever been in Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable I could go on and on but instead Ill just say GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,negative,true
This hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood The owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an upscale overpriced boutique hotel But its still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job Stay here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse but with all the sleaze removed Definitely stay at the chains other location the Burnham for a much much nicer hotel,negative,true
My Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro The room was so small The bathroom was ridiculously stupid everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself Truly one person at time in the bathroom it was like being in an airplanes bathroom The walls are so thin we heard the people across hall having sex The some staff were really rude I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out Check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating  do not disturb  The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms no mini fridge and no coffee maker either NO DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny We were there for four days and three nights so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car My Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again,negative,true
I stayed at the Allegro Hotel while interviewing for a position in Chicago I read the reviews and they were mixed but since the property was suggested by the organization due to location I booked a room True to the reviews the room was extremely small was cold the heater blew in cold air in 2 degree weather and just generally uncomfortable There was no closet so I hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room The bathroom was extremely small and although tidy not especially clean it was dusty The bed which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full was quite low and the sheets were hard Because I arrived late I ordered room service There was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desktable sideways Although there is free wireless a plus I kept getting kicked out of the system and had to no lie reconnect online a record 16 times Finally to top it all off the television stopped working just a little before midnight I was only there for one evening not even 12 hours but that was enough for me This is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but Ive stayed at better 2 star properties On the positive side the staff is nice and friendly the food is reasonably good and the lobby is really vibrant There is a martini bar although as I was coming in a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey that looked interesting Overall though not the best stay Ive had I wont be staying again,negative,true
This is about the fourth time we stayed at the Allegro The previous times I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro But my reaction has soured on this place We have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping From the very start this year was a disappointment I had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro I was quoted one price higher than what was on line when I mentioned this I was told I could have the lower price At check in the desk was nice but not friendly We discovered that our room was not as good as in the past punishment for asking for a lower price? The closet had no hangers we had no place to put our suitcase No one mentioned the wine reception in the evening On the second day we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing It took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one I wrote the management following our stay I have yet to receive a reply Needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time I would advise others to do the same,negative,true
This hotel is rather stupid to be frank Its a horrible attempt to be retrosheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isnt much in them I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink I had to put my makeup on using the toliet for 5days It also took me 10minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee bc the bathroom doors arent doors at all and there is no bathroom fan It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night On a good note the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean Thats about the only good thing I can say about this place I would not go back,negative,true
Me and my husband stayed in the Allegro Hotel Chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently We got a room with a king size bed Although the room is small we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages  all However we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us The walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound 1 of the days our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins This is unacceptable to us The hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night Although it is near the CTA trains i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view Am staying again at a Kimpton hotel in San Fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change Overall not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again,negative,true
We were at the Hotel Allegro for an Industry Analyst event I could not have expected worse At first glance you figured it couldnt be too bad as a Kimpton The unfortunate issue  service and the people were excellent However the rooms just sucked Imagine your normal hotel room and 13 that size Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom thats also 13 the size The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college The paints peeling on the base boards the carpet is new but something is wrong I would stay at the Marriott Renaissance Westin or any where else,negative,true
This place had character Ill give it that But it wasnt really my style Arrived late in the evening The first room they gave me the TV didnt work Maintenance took a look at it and couldnt figure it out Told me Id have to wait until the morning for the electrician He then passed some gas and left Real professional I phoned the front desk on account of the tv and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first Horrible striped wall paper dingy and old worn carpet Bathroom was incredibly small Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door or the sink Very cramped The beds werent very comfortable either Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy Location seem very convenient I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away But all of the theatres seemed to be near by if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two And dont make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card It was about 2minute I knew it would be expensive but wasnt expecting that type of rate,negative,true
where do I start The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had Anthony the Concierge  set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice He set me up and quoted me a price of 125 When i got to the spa which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was 100 with 20% off At the end of the massage I gave the lady 100 and said thanks you can keep the change She insisted that I got A Hotel Rate because Anthony set me up She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference  45 She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined In short  shady dealings with this place I was quite taken back The GM Selman compd me a night but  I felt swindled big time Stay somewhere else The concierge has something going on,negative,true
The room wasvery tiny and was very warm They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do The bathroom is small The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review and does crackle under your feet I personally did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in This is basically an old hotel that has been updated The comment about the closet is true it is actually indescriable You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms The location is convienent but so are many other hotels If you do stay fly into Midway take the Orange Line you cannot go wrong,negative,true
Im a frequent business traveler and often in Chicago on trips At times its very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown Chicago and this was one of those times I recently had to pay almost 400 for one night at the Allegro It was absolutely not worth it The hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers so checkin and checkout were very slow There were very few elevators which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests The morning I checked out our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby but the elevator was almost completely full when I got on at the 18th floor so I can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs The room was extremely small and cramped even though it had obviously been renovated recently The TV bed and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel Still the rate was way overpriced for such a small room The best thing about the Allegro was the room service which was prompt The food was good and the prices were very reasonable for room service From now on if my regular hotels are booked Ill just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isnt worth it,negative,true
As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left She seems to have a cough today In the room on my right someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit I hear the water running and the toilet flushing I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms Ive stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst The room is dirty  the carpet covered in spots and stains the curtains with a large brown stain I dont want to guess what it is paint peeling rips in the wallpaper The decor is a bit garish with PeptoBismol covered walls green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable but Im so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others toilets flushing all night The location is good for downtown theaters or business Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly Chicago has many nice hotel options  many Ive enjoyed quite a bit Unfortunately this is not one of them and even more unfortunate for me Im stuck here for two more nights I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip comfortable and attractive This is not,negative,true
I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels but this place is awful  I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left It is an old dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more botique  The carpets are dirty and tattered patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet yuck The bathrooms are tiny and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table We told the front desk called housekeeping and then called the front desk againfinally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum The elevators are slow and often only one is working at any given time I did not find the staff to be friendly at all except for one waiter @ breakfast What a disappointment ,negative,true
We stayed two nights We were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant He was very cold Our room was very very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days The room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet We were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level  however when we went to have a drink the door to the bar was locked We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasnt and were told they were short staffed sorry WHAT?? are you running here? You are a hotel in the countrys third largest city and your amenities are open at whim? This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel,negative,true
A disappointment to say the least I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brotherinlaw gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card since they do indeed take American Express I couldnt wait to get there We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 300 on Saturday afternoon Me the tourist I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding We get in the line to check in I give them the gift card and my check card They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate but for incidentals as well We give them a credit card instead While in line checking in we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bellman Someones luggage has been lost He desk clerk snaps at the bellman for the entire line to see Not impressed We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see The rooms on the website looked glorious My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room The sink is too small  water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room Yuck We stay the night and go to check out in the morning Again I give them the American Express gift card The clerk says their system usually doesnt take them I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday He swipes the card and bam it works What do you know?? He was so rude I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again nor would I recommend it to anyone Such a disappointment,negative,true
Check ins went smoothly But be advised Walls are super thin the building is old and the rooms are very very very small The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out For the price it wasnt bad It was walking distance to most major attractions Overall  its ok at best Another plus is the CTA is close by,negative,true
Sothe location to the ClarkLake train stop is greatand that is the only thing that is great with the hotel The wall are very thinso much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway There is no coffee maker in the room however free coffee is available in the lobbybecuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? Finally the business center is a pay for use setupno courtesty internet usage or printing Lastlythey bathroom is microtiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort,negative,true
As a frequent traveler to Chicago I generally stay at the Sutton Court but thought I would try a different boutique hotel I will never stay at this hotel again The first room they brought me to  their standard room  was a glorified closet leaving me absolutely claustrophobic Actually the smallest hotel room Ive been in in the US I complained to the front desk who then moved me to a premium room  still quite small but manageably so The bathroom was tiny without a vanity making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room The location leaves much to be desired as my room looked out directly onto the El elevated subway  background noise and the street was pretty deserted on a Sunday evening I will say that the free wifi was great If you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan Avene Id highly recommend you take that If you want a nice room in a great location check out Sutton Place hotel instead,negative,true
I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in its decor less traditional and more funky interior it is not nearly as nice The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice The rooms are also smaller The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though is the bathroom It has an old tiled floor with an old sink and old toilet It reminds me of something you would find in a mens locker room Although the Allegro has installed a nice mirror it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance Also the layout of the bathroom is terrible The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet Also the room is not very clean as well The floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers I would recommend staying at the Monaco Hard Rock or Soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice,negative,true
We recently stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago illinois while the hotel was nice please take my advice and do not stay here I payed cash for the room and handed over my credit card for incedentals 5000 the next day my debit card was charged 200 clearly this had to be a mistakei called the hotel manager who was the rudest person i have ever spoken with about the charge and was told that it was my fault i paid cash and that i could give him my bank account routing SS # and authorization code and he could call my bank and take care of it Clearly i am smart enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged I then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already credited my account and that they were sorry and it was clearly my mistake I then questioned them about the manager asking for all my information if they had already credited my account and they told me they didnt have an answer for me So for your bank accounts sake do not stay here they are many other options in chicago,negative,true
We were checked into a room with empty beer bottlesdirty shorts in the closet and an unclean bathroom There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints The front desk lady said the manager was on a LUNCH break at 7 PM We missed our show at Navy Pier because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience This was totally inappropiate since I had children including a teenager with me She gave me a 30 compensation for ruining our family holiday Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets I asked for two blanket but they delivered one I had to keep calling to get settled for the night I saw a filled out comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk who had taken the trouble of filling it out but no one collected it or cared for it Noisy rooms Can hear the doors open and close all night The breakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates,negative,true
We booked the Amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in Chicago The hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location However when i booked the hotel I was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only 10 more That was great until I checked in The corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley During the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley It would seem that this is a place for them to congregate On top of this the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning The noise was crazy loud I think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful,negative,true
We arrived and thought for 350 a night it would be a decent place Good reviewsetc We arrived to find that the website pictures were misleading The hotel lounge was a room it was really odd and very dark The first night there I noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking Resembled something youd find on a street To top it all off we woke up after night #2 to find that bed bugs had attacked us My husband and I were both bitten I was bitten WAY more than my husband My legs were covered with bites I was on ointments and Benadryl for over a week I immediately came home and scalded all our clothes There was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it The bathroom floor was also curling up by the tub The view in room #607 is of a roof Not good The stay was VERY disappointing The only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor,negative,true
The room itself was fine and comfortablevery peaceful but the customer service by the socalled concierge or experience something or the others left much to be desired First I arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk I was not greeted with the usual Hello welcome to Instead I got Your name? ID? No hello no welcome to the Amalfi Hotel just plain old poor customer service from the very beginning That left a very bad taste in my mouth but I decided to let it go and see how the rest of my stay was,negative,true
IMO the Amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on TA This is basically a Holiday Inn Half of the rooms overlook an alley  loading dock The hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am At 530 when you are just nodding off again they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast This is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank Any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise Reception was a bit tacky and the staff was a little rough around the edges I didnt see a single business travellers while I was there Valet parking was expensive usual for Chicago but was very slow Just ok Explore other options,negative,true
We were checked into a room with empty beer bottles dirty underwear in the closet and unclean bathroom There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints We missed our show because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles especially when I had a child and a teenager with me she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets I asked for two blanket  but they delivered one I had to keep calling to get settled I saw a comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk who had taken the trouble of filling it out but no one collected it or cared for it ht Noisy rooms Can hear the doors all night Thebreakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates,negative,true
The location was good Checkin was ok Asked for non smoking room given floor with half smoking half non smoking We could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened We asked for and recieved a room on a nonsmoking floor They did not bring up the key we had to go down to the lobby to get it Breakfast could have had some healthy choices the sweet rolls and danish were not fresh Bananas not ripe Room only had ONE wash cloth had to call down for more Housekeeping NEVER showed up at our room Not for turndown service  not for the morning clean up Called down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were accused of putting our the Do Not Disturb sign They said they would come up and they never came when they said they would We finally told them not to come because of the time We wanted to get ready to go out for dinner Never greeted by anyone as we came and went I have stayed at the Peninsula and the Burnham The Burnham was booked during our stay or I would have stayed thereI will NEVER stay at this hotel again Not worth 30000 a night,negative,true
I was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online Unfortunately it was a very disappointing experience When we arrived we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold So we had to move to another hotel Amalfi did take care of the other hotel cab fare and after much negotiatingbreakfast We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned we had to get up pack up our suitcases check out of the hotel take a cab check back into the Amalfi only then could we head to the museum We were also told that our first nights stay would be refunded Well more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls laterthere still hasnt been a refund I cant even get a manager to call me back The Amalfi wasnt all bad it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance The coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers However it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles but they seemed really small for queens Our view from our room was of the alley So overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor Very disappointing indeed,negative,true
Arrived at 130am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel If you party and stay out all night anyway this hotel would be fine But dont plan to get any rest if the club is open Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in She was fine with me and gave me a corner room but sure wouldnt want to be on her bad side,negative,true
Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party and was disappointed The hotel is beautiful the staff was all rather friendly The main problem was the roomsleeping situation We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out how that happens I dont know so they upgraded us to two suites with a king and a pull out First this meant our party was split up and on different floors Second that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch  Im not a picky unreasonable person but that was the WORST bed Ive ever slept on It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night Just awful For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable I would not stay here again after this experience,negative,true
Often visit Chicago but this was my first stay at this location Was able to secure a good rate through travelzoo Thought the room was clean and was nicely decorated Was very disappointed in the service Stayed on a Saturday night  waited 20 minutes for extra pillows  called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late Also received an incorrect folio under my dooranother guests that was staying at this location I called the front dest to inform them of the error  and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected I opened my credit card statement and found that I was charged for three different rooms  one on the date of my visit and two a week later I called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department Received a message to call the billing department have called three times  but have not received another reply back,negative,true
I booked this hotel for a business trip since I was able to get a 129 rate on Travelzoo and figured Id save my company some money I had also read excellent reviews on TripAdvisor I had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in November When I arrived in Chicago at 730pm I decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told no problem When I arrived at the hotel at 1145pm I was told they didnt have a room for me and that Id have to move to the Four Points Sheraton which they paid for It was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away I was told that they overbooked and didnt get as many cancellations as they expected I did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience I would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late checkins or you might not have a room The experience designers were great and very helpful The rooms were very nice and comfortable felt like home The breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the healthy factor It was nice that they did have fruit I think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotelthey just need to get the basics down,negative,true
We stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010 4th of July weekend I was very apprehensive about leaving my Diesel Ford Excursion with the valet at Amalfi It has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly I explained the procedure to the valet drivers and felt like it was a complete waste of time When the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as I had instructed When I tried to start it it wasnt happy but did finally start I was so relieved to get it back I just wanted to leave Driving away I noticed that the top speed recorded on the GPS was 105mph previous top speed was 95mph done a few days earlier driving across South Dakota I could just picture the flying Ferrari scene in Ferris Buellers Day Off I couldnt imagine where in the crowded Chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast though it wouldnt take long to make that happen see reference to modified engine above A little while later we stopped for lunch and I noticed a dent in the front bumper I contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people No remedy Lesson learned Brett,negative,true
Overview Overrated hotel in a premium location The Great Location  walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants bars and sights The Good Inviting lobby pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby in particular the night deskman Nice bathroom comfortable bed and desk chair The Mediocre Room excluding bathroom was underwhelming in design No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Carays across the street Free cocktails 57pm in lounge is right idea with wrong execution tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door Hot water or lack thereof  almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm Pressure is pretty low View  mine wasnt great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible The Bad Free wifi  ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day even when my computer wasnt moved  really aggravating Same deal for my iPhone I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Antivirus that makes me wonder how secure it is No blackout curtains I had a corner room with a huge wraparound window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night Never had this issue in any hotel or motel Ive ever stayed at Noise  the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling bar music trucks car horns and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel And the remote was useless In room bar had standard inflated prices but the 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting Dont even think of opening it theres a 7Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost Summary Not recommended Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star,negative,true
We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more Its a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but its just not worth the money It does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast The sheets though made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things The breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt Otherwise its just an early morning sugar attach of muffins danishes sweet breads and croissants There are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety if you are into that sort of thing Also the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room The problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time alternating between cold and warm right over the bed There is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale They do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free The problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there One person at a time All and all we will not stay there again If we feel like luxury we have to find some other place But if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that At least well know what we are paying for,negative,true
We went with the great reviews on Tripadvisor The location rooms amenities and price via Expedia were good My complaint is the poor service at every stage  the checkin was slow even at 1am the concierge Sarita was hopeless staff were generally rude Also there was some sort of generator box under the bed which hummed all night  we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning Finally just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and roadworks at 2am with trucks that beep continuously everytime they reverse Would I stay here again?  maybe if I got a good deal and had a back room but there are plenty of other great hotels nearby,negative,true
this is my letter to the management Sir or Madam I am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the Amalfi We were a guest from 1120 to 1123 During our stay we used the Valet Service operated through Standard Parking Our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments Much to my chagrin 44day valet service did not include proper securitymonitoring despite the premium over self park I understand that these parking services are subcontracted by the hotel but I would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation This was not the case I hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests,negative,true
My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor When I arrived I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone The room was very small and dark Then the Internet wasnt working I wasnt informed about this on my check in and couldnt be given a time frame when it would be back up I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking gathered up my belongings and went there If youre one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels youll lurve this place But if you like a hotel with lights on working internet and a good view and real breakfast go someplace else,negative,true
My wife and I stayed at the Amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from Norway who were vacationing in the City We were excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading the reviews here but really disappointed in the accommodations The web site has a photo of the 18 story building that houses the hotel It doesnt state that the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building The rest are offices Our room was on the 4th floor with a view of a blank brick wall about 16 feet distant The room itself was unremarkable with standard furnishings equivalent to a Holiday Inn Although it is close to the best part of the City it is tucked behind the new Trump Tower and opens on a surprisingly sketchy stretch of roadsidewalk Our Norwegian friends by contrast stayed on the 33rd floor of Swissotel and had views of the Lake and Navy Pier,negative,true
Stayed at the Amalfi hotel in Chicago this month with good expectations And what a disappointment Paid just under 200 for a deluxe king and what we got was a 2nd floor view of construction a dirty badly rehabbed bathroom itchy sheets no down comforter just sheets and the gross old hotel blanket thing  previously opened bottles in our mini bar and plenty of rude inexperienced staff members  managers def not a 3 or 4 star staffing I do live in Chicago and have stayed at a wide range of places I know that for 200 in February you can expect a great hotel As there were many available the weekend we stayed at Amalfi choosing it over say the Palmer House Hilton Hotel Sax Sutton Place Hotel 71 was a huge waste Definitely keep looking and book elsewhere Not worth the price at all dont let their pictures fool you Also I wouldnt say that our experience was just a rare mishap the hotel looks like an old Days Inn that had undergone a slight renvation ie new lamps,negative,true
I stayed here with a dozen of my friends and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs We stayed there from September 28  September 30th but the symptoms ie the crazy itchiness didnt come until Sunday night when we all got home I complained to the hotel and basically all theyre gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills Honestly they should reimburse us because it was not worth it at all DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL,negative,true
Reservation was for a King size bed instead I was given a doublebed room Checkin person must had a bad hair day because she was unfriendly Wall St Journal or USA Today is not complimentary Requested a room that is away from the noisy elevator but given a room next to a service elevator which is more noisy I didnt bother to file a formal complain because I was very tire I travel often to Chicago for business and the first will be the last at Intercontinental,negative,true
This is an older hotel and the age shows Rooms are small and a bit drab Bathroom in my room was in urgent need of upgrade Bed was comfortable though and the room was quiet Hotel staff was polite but not really interested in the guest Even the concierge was disinterested Checkin was irritatingly slow for the few number of people in line Really a hotel tjhat promises so much in its promotional material should deliver better The hotel really didnt seem to be trying,negative,true
First rooms heating system sounded like we had a generator in our room Second room had stool in the toilet and a smear on the linens which we didnt notice until morningeeewwhh The computer scale and ink pen didnt work The maintainance man took 30 mins to come unplug the toilet and dripped to toilet water through bathroom and on carpet This room was quiet and the bedpillows comfortable The bath was large and water warm,negative,true
In from Minneapolis and was hoping to stay on Michigan Ave at hotel When we arrived we were told a previous guest had extended their stay so we did not have a room The hotel moved us to another hotel 2 miles away in a less than desireable location Management on duty was unfriendly and even stated they would call security if we did not leave They gave us 15 for cab fare Will never stay there again Happened to numerous guests the same weekend,negative,true
The location is amazing right across from Nordstroms on Michigan Avenue The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are clean But We are Intercontinental Ambassadors the rewards club and to get to the Ambassador suite level we have to ride a private express elevator The elevator took three minutes to get to the thirtieth floor When we checked in the person behind the counter was rude and acted as if we were lucky to get checkedin Also there was a language barrier becuase she was Russian The pool and spa were both beautiful but we had to pay an extra fee because of upkeep If you want a nice hotel all the way aroundgo to the Omni,negative,true
What can I say this USED to be our FAVORITE hotel in Chicago because of its location its historic and gorgeous pool it amazing Sunday brunch its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership All of the above has fallen disappointingly by the wayside with a resounding THUD Lets break it down Location Ill concede that its still great Get a corner room in the Historic tower higher than the 20th floor with a view of Michigan Ave andor the river Its historic and gorgeous pool Closed indefinitely When asked when it will reopen the hotel staff actually said Maybe never Its amazing Sunday brunch Zest is gone and his been replaced by a very dark Michael Jordan restaurant that takes up much of the lobby and second entrance The lobby by the way used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit Also no longer The food is very bad Very Bad There are so many restaurants in this city Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat Its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels Based on my review of everything else Go to the Drake or the Peninsula Completely worth the extra money That or downgrade to the Hilton and get what you expect and pay for The InterContinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the Hilton but you get a worse experience Its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership I canceled our membership after this disaster Part of the membership includes early checkin granted when available but our room wasnt ready until 6pm This is obviously after normal checkin The staff was overwhelmed and not effective or helpful I tried to speak with the manager about our room waited in long line to speak with someone only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name In a nutshell Go somewhere else ps Go to Argo tea next door instead of the Starbucks in the hotel Way better food and coffee,negative,true
After reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels particularly the Mark Hopkins in SF I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club When I arrived at the hotel there was no separate checkin line as advertised and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty They gave me a room in the modern tower built in the 60s which was about 23 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins built in 29 I had to deal with torn sheets cracked marble sinks and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet  how convenient is that? The closet door if you are not careful may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service which never happened The next day they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and entitled to an upgraded room but since I travel with a medical device which I already set up in the tiny room I declined To their credit they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be entitled to as an Ambassador Club member I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago There are other better places for the money including the Omni The James The Fairmont Hyatt Sheraton Monaco Crowne Plaza even the Holiday Inn and Marriotts located in the same general area,negative,true
Good location and looks like a good property but did not seem to be managed well Front desk staff was inattentive to customers and slow Nice large suite for a room but plumbing fixtures were in disrepair housekeeping staff couldshould have reported each day  partially clogged shower head dripping sink etc Clean and OK but neglected  we expected more from an Intercontinental Hotel Many hotels to choose from in this area of Chicago  can get more for the price from almost any other,negative,true
Stayed in old tower Room was nice and room service was very good Room WiFi was expensive as was the bottled water For the price of the room at least there should at least have been water I would rate the value as subpar The restaurant menu was not great food mediocre by comparison to other downtown Chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant In summary I will go to the M or H next time Some of the above comments are based on a previous week resort stay on the outer banks of North Carolina and earlier this year in Northern California PS If you are a fitness room user the 16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel,negative,true
We booked directly with the Intercontinentala special room for our wedding night After our wedding we went to the Hotel excited and happy When we got there the night changed We were treated rudely and with no respect They told us there was no room even though we had a confirmation number Instead of showing any empathy they told us to go sit down while they figured out what to do with us My husband was in his tux and I was in my wedding gown No apology No concern We were given 20 and told to go find a cab and take it to a hotel where theyd found a room The Intercontinental RUINED our wedding night We are telling anyone and everyone of our experience This place was supposed to be elegant Weve never been treated so poorly We will never stay in another Intercontinental Hotel and highly recommend you do not contribute to a place that would do this to a newly married couple STEER clear of this place,negative,true
Whats not to like? > Problems getting the room you actually reserved I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved > Overcharging They charge for everything here Wireless The Fitness Center The Business Center Ive only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center Note to the Intercontinental If youre going to charge for something that is commonly included you should advertise that fact Whats next? Charging for sheets on the bed? > Very poor customer service The staff does not communicate in full sentences or wait to hear your answer This is Chicago not New York How about a little Midwestern patience?,negative,true
To start with this hotel had the worst customer service They were impossible to work with on EVERYTHING Now the problems we had in chronological order First we arrive at 8 PM Sat to check in They did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway free of charge However the room was not ready yet Finally at 1030 25 hrs later we were able to get our room keys But there was no rollaway Another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later we had a rollaway but had to get the charge waived a second time Now we go to check out on Mon and they couldnt print us a bill or give us a total We stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn 212700 We called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 TIMES for 709 each when our bill was supposed to be 450 After sitting at the gas station on the phone for 15hrs the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home I would recommend a Holiday Inn over the Intercontinental any day,negative,true
Overall the hotel is very nice The rooms are spacious and wellappointed but they tend to be aging or dated My bathroom was particularly below average with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead The toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed The conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant I hate it when they do that it makes me suspect theyre getting kickbacks from places that otherwise dont get enough business on their own Breakfast was very good Its a relatively large europeanstyle spread,negative,true
Spent three nights in Chicago at this property First of all I have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the Magnificent Mile close to terrific restaurants the Art Institute and Orchestra Hall The hotel has two sides  the historic tower and a new wing The rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired This property needs to be renovated Some observations The junior suite I had was laid out strangely A small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom The mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right  made shaving a challenge and messy While descending in the elevator one morning it started shaking so violently that I could barely stand up It stopped on the 11th floor and I was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down This experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up  an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness Reports from my group were of sinks stopped up exposed bolts in rooms and generally things not working Now the good news  the staff is terrific They make you feel welcome are personable have their own personalities great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help I wish they had a better property to work in,negative,true
It is always interesting going to a high quality Hotel I cannot help but think about the service and the value Maybe I have too high expectations Certaintly the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great But the room was not well cleaned a little smelly truthfully and they stole a watch that I left in the room The hotel where immediately worried about there financial situation and not the service I noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel I know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this Overall Chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not Stay else where,negative,true
Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago For the prices and for being classified an intercontinentalI wouldnt consider it that good The rooms were solid The view was ok but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave The service was ok The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else We came here for a JewishHindi wedding Appetizer was fine Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else Dessert was inedible I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it I personally preferred the Conrad Better prices and better service,negative,true
I am writing in regards to our stay April 2224 We were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay There was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay My husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrivalit wasnt When he called to place the order again it never showed up We were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time Our room was very small drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for We had called to request a room with a large tub similar to the ones in the photos prior to our arrival noting that we didnt mind an upgrade cost Instead the tub was incredibly small We have stayed at the Intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the Chicago location especially considering we were celebrating such a happy onceinalifetime occasion The service and amenities just didnt match up,negative,true
Stayed here in November 2011 on a leisure trip to Chicago Hotel is very dated with some rooms that just arent good enough Front desk staff was rude Will not be staying here again  prefer the Swissotel and the Hyatt properties Regency is similarly priced and Park Hyatt is 3x more and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well Kimpton etc Pros The only hotel that opens onto Michigan Avenue very close to all of the excitement Eno Wine Bar has a great selection of cheeses Rooms are clean Cons Some hotel rooms just make no sense  our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge effectively no view and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall actually no view You have to pay for everything  internet gym and the pool which was not available due to renovation Entire hotel was very old not in a classical sense but in a ghost story one Front desk staff was rude,negative,true
When you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport you areusually not in the best of mood I working in a upscale hotel do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to All they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in The desk clerk who checked me in at this property did neither She was short rude handed me my keys and walked away I would never go back to this property due to this,negative,true
Ok I just feel if youre paying well over 200 for a room you should get something to show for it The location was on Michigan Ave but if I pay just a little more I could have had way better Peninsula Park Hyatt shoot the Omni was 10x better We ordered a deluxe executive suite and it was so below sub par The room was very small so small the ice bucket was in the closet the bathroom was just as small just well lit a plus Wallpaper was peeling outlets barely covered no view The only thing appealing was the bed and that may have been because I was so tired And we were really excited because this is the Palmer House The Palmer House does have nice restaurants the Lockwood quiet distinguished and the Potters Lounge grownsexy,negative,true
First of all Expediacom charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when I arrived at the Hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered The Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel When we went to leave the gate would not open We had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up They confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure The Hotel itself is beautiful The bell hops and doormen were just wonderful They were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all,negative,true
I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center which is truly annoying In addition there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator Other than that it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm But the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed so they shoved it off to the side Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel It should not be sold as a hotel room,negative,true
The hotel is almost always very helpful This stay caused me to rethink if I like the Palmer House I had dirty covers for the bed It was also the smallest room in the hotel I am sure My husband and I usually come 8 times each year He is there doing Business and CTA work We are not pleased with the size of the room at all now Rooms have always had two chairs desk and usually 22 by 25 feet Not this room on the 11th floor It was only 15 X 17 approx The service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time In the past we had a bell man steal a 300 pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially,negative,true
We stay at the Palmer House when we attend conferences in Chicago It is a stately building But this year there were  problems we have not had before First they now have wifi available but it is not free The cost is 750 per hour Online it indicated that Hilton hotels charge about 4 but this was almost double Many hotels have free wifi Wifi is wifi so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost They also charge for their fitness center even when you are only going to use the machines There is no business center inhouse for copies etc Our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room It did not separate us from the bathroom noises When someone took a shower at 530 am the pipes sung like old pipes dobut very loudly An empty wine glass sat outside someones room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping The concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line If you called down you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line The staff were all very nice and the location cant be beat but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year I doubt well return,negative,true
I stayed at Palmer House for one night in early January this year During the check in the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation I did not bring the confirmation with me because I had not been asked to present it in other places during check inSo she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key I did what she told me and went to the bell station However people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key A bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk I finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes As other people pointed out before the room I got was small and old with a twin bed and I could hear people next door using the bathroom This was not a pleasant experience even though I paid over 100 dollars to the hotel,negative,true
My husband and I and our 10 month old took a quick trip to Chicago We stayed one night at The Palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel I guess I am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel Yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small I couldnt set up a pack and play for my son I had to call and upgrade my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep The lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a Holiday Inn The wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty I will NEVER stay there again,negative,true
Not impressed at ALL The hotel itself looks really nice especially in the big foyer area Our room was small and the bathroom needed some major upgrades It had the green tile like at your grandmothers house all over the walls and 2 people couldnt fit in it if you tried We could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning so obvioulsy the walls arent so thick Our room looked directly on to a brick building outside VERY close we couldnt even tell if it was nice outside or not We are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it and I felt yucky the whole time in it I just wouldnt pay lots of money to stay here there is nothing exceptional about it at all,negative,true
The hotel is excellently situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park It is an old classic of a hotel and the main lobby is a must see but I would not stay there again The problem with any hotel dating from long ago the current one was built in 192325 is that even with extensive remodeling which was done in 20072009 it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much We had a reasonably sized room king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries Also there was no coffee machine in the room  something I have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days My major complaint about this stay was the Executive Lounge It is usually worth while to pay the extra for access  in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors doeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price Since we are currently at the diamond level in the Hilton Honors program we get access for free at the Hiltons but I usually upgrade at other chains such as the Hyatt At the Palmer Executive Lounge I ordered a couple of glasses of wine there was a bartender on duty and was slightly surprised by the cost  9glass which came to 2144 for two with tax and tip  and was even more surprised by the wine It was about the worst wine I had tasted in many years I didnt think it was even as good as Trader Joes cheapest 299 wine that I tried a couple of weeks ago Unfortunately I didnt get a look at the bottle to see what it was although I did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard I noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in  and I can understand iot at the prices they were charging It then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time I checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass  the same three varietals as at the bar The cabernet was a William Hill at 1050glass from room service I presume that what I had had at some time been a William Hill that had been left to turn to vinegar It was slightly more expensive from room service but I hope that it was in a lot better condition,negative,true
I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day No fridge or microwave included in the price Our room had two too soft full size beds In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall Who doesnt believe it check out the 16th floor close to room 212 With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby,negative,true
Will not stay here again We were here preconstruction so didnt have the noise problems that others are now experiencing But room and service quality were so poor that we will not return Our suite was large enough but it was dirty dated and worn The bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly Public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days disgusting We politely requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed We had paid for the King Tut Package which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit They had no record of this and didnt honor it Of course the exhibit was sold out so our main reason for visiting Chicago was ruined as we werent able to see this part of the Field museum My also polite letter to Hilton and the manager was never acknowledged Very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding Hilton in general when possible,negative,true
Booked through Hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage The view was of the inner courtyard of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms You were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night They no longer have inroom coffee appliances You either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room or go around the corner to Starbucks or McDonalds Internet access is not free 129524 hours the Gift Shop is a joke tucked away in the corner of the coat check room Concierge services have limited hours and the business center is open only during business hours which made it difficult to get work done after business hours I would not stay there ever again nor do I recommend it to anyone I have had better stays at any Holiday Inn Express,negative,true
After Leaving some important documents in the room I called and asked for the lost and found department SEVEN TIMES over the course of a week Eventually I had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected Finally  a deceivingly friendly operator PROMISED me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes It never happened So Avoid this place because after they rip you off once theyll keep doing it later They cannot be trusted at their word,negative,true
Here are my experiences  Had three rooms reserved when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms  screwed up initial room assignments gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in  Could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys  In room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th  could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th  When we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room  When we received our bills the credit card assignments were still wrong I stay at economy hotels a lot and I have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one This hotel should do Chicago a service and just close its doors Due to this experience I will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad,negative,true
How about this had reservation confirmation in hand and still had to argue with the registration desk about price on reservation She tried to charge me price on bill they slide under your door Sorry not on my watch Then about this room you gave me I understand this place is old but for the price you charge how about some indoor plumbing You take a shower and the tub fills with water will not drain this is absolutely redickulas for this being a Hilton I think you should step back and take a look at how this place is operating Registration Fail Parking price Fail Plumbing Fail Thank you Hilton for for my super 8 experience in Chicago,negative,true
The Palmer House has a beautiful lobby with a great bar and restaurant The rooms are way too small Two people in a room with a King size bed can barely move around Not enough room for two suitcases Our room was very outdatedreminded us of the movie The Shining VERY NOISY Dont expect a quiet stay You can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbors are doing and saying not to mention everything that is happening in the hallways We requested a room change as soon as we checked in The room that we originally were in had a huge square cut out of the wall that had exposed pipes bricks dirt and dust Oh and the construction for their renovations starts at 7 am during the week We will never stay at the Palmer House again You are better off spending a few more dollars at a different hotel,negative,true
great expectations from the hotel of THE FUGITIVE Wonderful lobby AND THATS IT The room was old in style and furnitures the tv was from the other century no minibar no wireless internet no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room those guys ignore that we are in the era of IPAD without cable connections small room small bathroom rude service room they have lost my credit card number and want CASH ON DELIVERY for a breakfast of 20 dollars Robbery in the business center 059 cents a MINUTE for internet connection you have to pay to use word or excel NEVER AGAIN,negative,true
For a Hilton hotel I was very unimpressed the rooms are incredibly small there are no refrigirator or coffee machine for coffee or tea Wifi costs an arm Plus side there is a Starbucks at the bottom but only limited opening hours the lobby is very nice Location is decent,negative,true
Beautiful historic hotel  and since Im in historic building business was looking forward to stay Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up  duct work torn apart in bathroom lamp fixtures literally falling off wall mirror torn off wall etc Ended up in a room on 20th floor  much nicer but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions Only two of three elevators to top floors work  and these two elevators skip floors so you can be stuck waiting for ever When I raised this to hotel staff was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it Umm no This is not an old building problem this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it Thumbs way down stay away Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if youre looking for old world charm sans hassle,negative,true
The heating in our room didnt work and wasnt repaired depite numerous requests the rooms were very small the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay the cleaner made the bed but nothing else when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the 5 night stay despite my having prepaid through a travel agent it took the hotel 2 months to recredit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous transAtlantic phone calls to them,negative,true
My 200 Gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the 16th I filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them This was such a disappointment as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in Chicago Our room was really nice with 2 bathrooms We had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed We had a great view of the lake and park The hotel charged us 25 to check in early 10am,positive,true
This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby However when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty Wireless internet is available but thats an additional fee Are you kidding? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free Also the fitness room was available for only 15 per day Wow I thought the room rate was enough to cover that When I used the coffee supplies in the room they were not replenished I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasnt housekeepings area but they would send some up No kidding nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar Glad I wasnt in a big hurry Ill definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time Im in Chicago,positive,true
The hotel is very impressive upon entering and the staff was very friendly however we felt our room was very dated and worn looking Our air conditioning didnt seem to be working well but we turned it down and thought that it would eventually cool off Our first night was interrupted by a phone call at one AM That was a fax it happened 4 times By this time we realized that the air was not working again so after fussing with the controls it did kick on The next morning I mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone but didnt think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working After being out seeing the sites of Chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to resting in a cool room before going to a show  Our room was 78 degrees I called and maintenience did come to check After determining that the unit needed a motor it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out I feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel Also was very surprised that WiFi was not a free service  We will not be staying at the Hilton on our next trip to Chicago,positive,true
Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services First of all from reading other reviews now I know I got ripped @ 249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for 79 albiet I got free wifi The hotel is nice but it can only get so nice for an oldieno matter how much money you dump into it Shower head was really low Im 61 water pressure was low It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by check out reviews on Yelp For some off reason I ended up with two double beds they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone If traveling here 1  make sure you get a better deal than I did 2  confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3  Dont have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor nor was it a good fit for the romantic coupleit wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers sp? trying to save money,positive,true
I checked into this hotel Rm 1760 on 11132010 Next day I woke up with bed bug bites numerous on my arm and back We reported this to the management who assiged us to rm 1901 and promised to get the room inspected and taken care of I insisted that they get all my clothes laundered which they did Interestingly no one from the management other than the security guy who came when we first complained even offered any apology for the inconvience I missed couple of meetings that day The next day I called as I forgot something in the previous room only to discover that the room was already assigned to the next guest So much for reporting,positive,true
I expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment Housekeeping and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesnt go down past 74 the closet is 24 wide all olddirty brass fixtures beds that are a little bigger than a twin showerheads that barely put out water then this is your hotel I might be spoiled by staying in Marriotts but I stay in hotels 13 of the year and was severly disappionted No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again,positive,true
I stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was host to a conference I was attending Before I arrived I tried to find out about the In Room Fitness program advertised on the corporate website I called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center I explained that I was inquiring about the In Room Fitness advertised on their website She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly I did and got the same response I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room Again this was a problem When I arrived at the hotel no treadmill was available When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge 13 per day to use the fitness equipment The pool track and locker room are free but to use the treadmills etc you have to pay 13 per day This charge is not noted anywhere  not on the website not in any of the guest service materials in the room The food for the conference was mediocre but the one room service meal I had was pretty good During one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldnt hear the speaker The HVAC didnt work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay The beds were comfortable with very nice linens I tried to get a late checkout which was offered on a card in my room The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour not the 112pm range advertised in my room The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I couldnt carry it out of the hotel I visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the Marriott properties Only wish I had done so for this visit,positive,true
I stayed there on October 6 2012 When I pulled the covers of my bed there was a small dark brown insect the size of a grain of rice which was either a bed bug or cockroach I trapped it under a glass see the attached pictures and called the front desk The housecleaning person claimed it was a cockroach Absolutely horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem failing to follow through on promises they made to me Setting aside the bug problem I caution that the windows are quite thin We could hear a lot of the street noise which made for a hard nights sleep not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms For 400 a night after tax I strongly encourage you to check for alternatives,positive,true
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed The highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage Finally my 72 year old mother 8 year old son and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves  no easy task The security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me The valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us As far as I could tell he was just standing there doing nothing I couldnt let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking receipt The attendant pointed to where our car was parked  no short distance away My 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up They should have been ashamed Less significant but irritating issues The pool is part of the Hilton Athletic club Two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim Basically two adults can take up 23rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 13rd This is ridiculous and very family unfriendly In addition the pool closes at 9 pm What pool closes at 9? We stayed for 3 nights Not one single additional bar of soap bottle of shampoo or coffee stirrers,positive,true
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago because I was attending a conference at the hotel The room was sufficient  had a coffee maker bed hangers tv etc Thats about where my compliments end *restaurant rates are outrageous 21 for a breakfast buffet? 25 to use the gym? 750hr for WiFi?? This is unacceptable when Im paying 249 per night Thank goodness the ice was free *servers in the restaurant and bar were surly not wellversed in English and just rude *computer monitors in rooms are silly and turn on at random times during the night *conference was incredibly coldeverybody was wearing their overcoats the entire time despite our complaints to management *fridge in room was not usable had to store cold items in the ice bucket *Cable channels just flat out SUCKED I was soooo bored when I had to spend an hour in my room If Im paying that much at least provide the full 70 channels,positive,true
Elegant lobby comfy beds nice sheets but we were given a not fancy a little dated room on the 5th floor which had a view of the monstrous venting structure and was located off the lobby so we heard the elevator all night At the Hilton one is charged for Internet access on each device per hour We stayed in the middle of Ohio and received total access for free We didnt drink the 600 water or try the 28 Breakfast buffet The staff was friendly but of course you tip for a smile They did give us a cot for free as we had asked for a room with a foldout couch as we were a party of 5 Didnt use the gym or pool on the 8th floor but looked nice small pool No view of the water possible though we were right at Grant Park We tried to view the fireworks from a higher story no such luck read more,positive,true
Months prior to my 5night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light facing an open view not a close building The reservation was made through a conference travel agency I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at checkin the clerk noted it in my record She told me it would be difficult to find but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers tucked into a very dark corner facing a wall of rooms I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request but to sit tight and someone would call me No one did Further calls yielded similar results At one point I was told I could have a parlor room with a sofa bed at a reduced rate but I could not go see the room before committing to moving Thats real hospitality for you Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms Other than that it was tight quarters with a tiny closet two uncomfortably low chairs at the desk and in a dark corner Light fixtures didnt do much to brighten things up Since I was here at a conference I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for midday calls and email but instead I got a cave Consequently I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago conference or not I will absolutely stay at another hotel There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of inside tower rooms places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service Shame on the Chicago Hilton,positive,true
I recently stayed here for the Chicago triathlon This was my third stay at this hotel I have not had any issues until this visit After the 3rd day of my stay I requested my room to be serviced and returned to what I thought was a clean room While getting out of bed I was cut by a piece of glass in the carpet I must not have been the first person to be cut in the room because I found dried blood on the bathroom floor afterwards I had not noticed it before so I was very disgusted We notified the staff and asked that the room be vacuumed and the bathroom mopped We returned to the room after 5pm to find that the dried blood was still on the floor After making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no reply from the hotel Considering the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably Luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago,positive,true
Our nonsmoking room smelled very badly of stale cigarette smoke We were not allowed to change rooms Also the concierge staff was unprofessional telling long winded personal stories to uninterested guests while long lines formed The location was great Hotel is dated but would still be a nice place to stay if it werent for customer service issues,positive,true
I stay in Chicago all the time on business and had my first stay at the Chicago Hilton I pretty much only stay at Hilton properties and have stayed at tons from Hawaii all the way to Budapest This Hilton is not up to par Its clean and the front desk staff is nice but in Chicago The Drake Doubletree Guest Suites and even the Hilton Garden Inn are all superior to the Chicago Hilton and less expensive Compared to other Hilton properties in Chicago the rooms were not as well appointed the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice the TV was tiny the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long and the breakfast you get was more like a Hampton Inn than a 4 star hotel If youre going to Chicago and you like Hilton brand hotels you can do far better than this place,positive,true
My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights beat up and old dorm style It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely All night there are chimes that make noise that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying There is no wifi  no matter what they tell you I paid for the wifi and still we were unable to get on Lastly my sister and I split the bill I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit Room cost with city taxes etc was 31369 a night I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper So while the View was wonderful it is NOT worth the money,positive,true
When I called to edit my existing reservation I was placed on hold for 30 minutes Finally someone came on the phone and said Ill have to transfer you so I was put on hold for another 5 minutes When I finally did get to speak to someone as I was going through my changes I asked her to send me a revised copy of the reservation to which she huffed and acted very put off Before she was able to disconnect with me I said I have one more question to which she replied Im working at the front desk and I have customers waiting I thought so am I not your customer? pathetic and rude Hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay,positive,true
Visiting during a busy 2day conference in Chicago Most hotels booked solid The full hotel allows you to meet a wide array of customers Everyone is complaining about service cleanliness and overall experience Location is good Hotel is tired Employees surly Too many cool properties to choose from in this town will never stay here again and will rethink Hilton in general,positive,true
Its not a bad hotel Its just sodisappointing As a Diamond member I expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view Im not distraught over this but come on Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge which has nothing but fattening pastries bagels and cereal Lowlevel Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame And whats with the lounge not opening until 630am? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 630 not sitting down to their meager breakfast The inroom wifi is a pain to access and I somehow got stuck with the 1999 plan even though I selected the basic plan Dont get me started on how a 89night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a fullservice Hilton  Towers seemingly cant Finally whats with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? Its an unseemly waste of space especially when the rooms are so meager And the goldplated bathroom fixtures scream 1992 not 2009 as does the picturetube TV vs flat panel Overall this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed,positive,true
Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting The hotel has some elegance in the lobby meeting rooms and lounges  the hotel rooms could definitely use updating I would definitely say that for the price of a room here  the rooms should be top notch My car was misplaced during valet parking our reservations were messed up hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items room service a new coffee pot laundry that wasnt ours I would not stay at this property again There are much better places for the money in close proximity to Michigan Ave It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at Faulty Towers,positive,true
My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff They sent engineers three times to repair the unit and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasnt under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty At my parents request the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room Dont book this hotel in the summer And by the way there is no view at all from any of the rooms  except for the windows of other buildings,positive,true
We ate at the Prime House restaurant last year that is why we picked the hotel Last year the food and service at the Prime House was outstanding This year the service felt rushed The waitress even asked why we were eating so early It was 630pm Our room in the hotel felt cramped The beds were comfortable The bathroom had maintenance problems The maid service and turndown out night was good All of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful I just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying,positive,true
Just returned from the James Hotel after staying at the Park Hyatt I have stayed at most Chicago Hotels Pennisula Four Seasons The Ritz Fairmont etc Had heard a little about the James and the Primehouse at the James We paid MORE for the room at the James then at any of the above mentioned hotels What a disappoitment The room we stayed in had 2 double beds The toilet broke and overflowed the tub didnt drain while showering and the HUGE bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times The closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all The room was very small and non descript Much like staying at an IKEA but without the color Windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small The staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly The room had a huge 52 plasma TV that was nice There is NO way this hotel is 4 star yet The room rate close to 50000 a night was WAY of of line We paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels The rate should have been about half of that,positive,true
I recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby While the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers When we arrived it took over an hour to check in We had requested two rooms on the same floor which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival When we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it Eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there We also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers When we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in We also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping We filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests After complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate This something never arrived We will not be making a return visit to this hotel While the housekeeping staff location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative,positive,true
Very disapointed in the service and quality of this hotel I travel quite frequently to chicago and have never had this happen at any other 4 star hotel I reserved a king bed At checkin I was informed they were out of kings and basically offered no type of compensation or upgrade When i arrived at the room the air conditioner door was open and rattled all night The TV did not work Had to call for service The following day returned from work at 6pm and found the room had not even been serviced Stay somewhere else,positive,true
Me My sister and my best friend all went to stay here in the summer of 2004they said there all spacious suitesyeah rightour room you could barely walk inand they said theres 2 double bedsyeah well one was a pull out couchand the bathroomtiny tiny tinyand it took forever and a day to check in and the people blamed us for throwing a book out the window and somehow someone knew exactly where it fell from and which roomyeahi wouldnt stay here again,positive,true
I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite No desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table  and canted forward Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos I have to assume this design flaw with the couchfuton runs throughout the property Bed was fine and bath was fine but I cant imagine why business travelers would rate this property well The couchfuton seating is the worst Ive encountered in a modern hotel,positive,true
This hotel does not belong in the same league as The Peninsula Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel Staff was very nice and attentive but the lobby is cramped and only two small elevators for 17 floors Several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor and we were forced to take the stairs The hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews,positive,true
I havent actually stayed at this hotel yet but am already disappointed in their customer service I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotels Cyber Monday Special The promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website the hotel will match that amount in James Credits that can be used toward your stay None of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits My next trip to Chicago is in April so I thought Id give The James a try I travel frequently with my pet and Ive heard they have a very liberal petpolicy So today I went online and bought a 500 certificate Me having the one track mind that I do somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31 2010 I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament I said I couldnt be in Chicago until April Im overseas on business until then and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month or it not refund my gift certificate purchase I had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadnt even recieved my email confirmation yet Most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period The girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me basically saying too bad its your problem now She didnt even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel or try Hotel Monaco I hear they have great service and are good with pets too,positive,true
This hotel was not worth it From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out the staff were rude and contemptuous Rooms were only serviceable and certainly did not live up to the pompous selfdescriptions on the website The bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient The fitness centre was tiny and poor We would not come here again,positive,true
We had a reservation for 3 rooms with 5 adults and 2 kids got only 2 rooms on arrival 2 of the corner rooms with an extra room During the night it was very cold and we were not able to change the ac even though we switched it off it went on cooling strange At night it was very loud from the street In the morning they uploaded something infront of our window and I stood vertically in the bed not what you need if you only spend 1 night in a hotel We came here a few years ago and had it better in mind The area is in good walking distance to all famous shopping places very good Clean and fancy Sorry but next time we`ll be looking for a more quiet hotel in Chicago,positive,true
In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer it sucks if your air conditioner does not work After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room I requested a room change and a not so polite unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity Maybe a manager could help me in the morning The next day went by and no call was received At 7pm I called the front desk No one was aware of my problem Approximately 45 minutes later a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available I accepted it was glee Anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer I was paritally correct The bathroom door of the new room did not close Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the shy part of the relationship As for room 1618 I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner Whats unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room And did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna This hotel need a major overhaul,positive,true
We stayed at the James hotel for a 40th birthday The location was excellent for shopping and restaurants but also very loud The room was horrible VERY SMALL We had a doubledouble and it was the size of a college dorm room plus completely white walls and linens Absolutely no color except for one accent pillow It was very sterile and uninviting We were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting It looked like the entrance to hell if not a haunted house Staff was very nice and accomodating I would not return to this hotel,positive,true
While the James was once considered an elegant chic establishment it has lost its luster The small rooms are filled with cheap Ikea type furnishings Our tiny bathroom flooded with water that escaped the shower curtain Showers and flushings from neighboring rooms sounded more like protective levies collapsing The 2 small elevators could not handle the guests and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended periods of time The thin windows could not contain street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night It was rather provocative to listen to the couple next door carousing but also rather tacky  unsettling It took more then 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out This hotel has lost it and the James sysndicate will have a difficult time competing in New Yorks Soho when they try to open in September New Yorkers will not tolerate shabby incompetence,positive,true
I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel I had requested a high floor quiet room Neither request was honored The windows are not well insulated because the traffic car horns and sirens continued all night long On the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway The safe in our room did not work Someone had locked it before our arrival One of the pictures under the tv had been removed leaving a screw sticking out of the wall The lights are so dim that is next to impossible to read A small alcove with a stained bench had a reading light that was about 50 watts Our room key cards didnt work so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them Upon returning to our room they didnt work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff The bathroom is small and has no fan so the steam covers the mirrors and unless you leave the bathroom door open it does not clear On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room What about a second guest Are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie??? On Sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call We had not requested to be woken up The concierge did not know the way to get to OHare by train and gave us a longer route than was necessary I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicagoquieter and more spacious more elegant and worth the money This is definitely not worth 400 a month By the way I live in Washington DC and am used to city noise This was unacceptable,positive,true
First several day s prior to my stay I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for roomservice Saturday and Sunday Saturday they didnt bring breakfast  and when I called roomservice they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge When they finally did bring it  they brought the wrong thing and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday I was further inconvenienced by inroom dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night The food was limp and uninspired Further I ordered soup  which arrived without a spoon When I called inroom dining to request a spoon I was told one would be forthcoming 15 minutes later a waiter arrived with a menu When I explained I already had food and I didnt need a menu  I needed a spoon he had the audacity to argue with me I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so Another 15 minutes and one bowl of cold soup later I decided to call inroom dining back to request again they send someone with a spoon They too argued with me and expressed that theyd already sent someone with a spoon I explained that they had not  that I had received a menu I didnt request but that no spoon was forthcoming Another 15 minutes later a spoon finally arrived Thanks  for charging me 100+ so that I could argue over cold flavorless food In addition to the gross customer service surly attitude and sorry food I found the room woefully lacking It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell Further I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went,positive,true
I have stayed at the James a few times it is my go to hotel in Chicago This last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options The Good Location is awesome just off Michigan Ave Trader Joes across street for some healthier snacking It is a great location easy to walk most anywhere The door staff are very friendly and helpful The overall feeling is modern upbeat Turn down service with cookie is nice Free Wifi which worked to varying degrees throughout stay The Bad They claim to be a 45 star hotel which to me means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star without a pool They used to have Kiehls toiletries and now have Harmony brand Additionally they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you It is what I would expect from Holiday Inn or my gym but not a 45 star hotel I asked about the switch mainly because when I booked they still had Kiehls in website description and they claimed that the reason they went the communal bottle route was to be green That is hard to believe as its not like the hotel is making other efforts to be green they still have incandescent light bulbs housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down they dont recycle in room etc They are obviously trying to cut costs and it shows More the rooms are in need of some updating they are looking somewhat tired My third floor room was quite loud with the motorcyclers trying to prove their manhood out front not their fault Dont take the stairs as the stairwell is straight out of horror movie even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be awhile The phone staff was fairly rude granted they didnt like me questioning their toiletry change I feel bad giving such a low rating but it really did not come close to my expectations from previous stays there I will start trying out new hotels in the area,positive,true
My inlaws booked a one night stay for New Years Eve for the two of us to stay at the James To be brief there were a few things wrong with our stay which will prevent us from returning and advising our friends not to stay there 1 Shoddy construction of room fixtures ceiling light was missing leaving a fistsized hole with wires exposed BOTH towel racks fell off the wall without being touched and bathroom door often came off its sliding mechanism with gentle use 2 When we reported these problems employees simply put the towel racks back on the wall without properly adhering them to the wall 3 Upon checkout they did not have record of my inlaws paying for our stay though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us We had to pay for our 300 gift and the inlaws were extremely upset When we wrote a letter to management as a manager was not available to speak with us when we left we did not receive an adequate apology,positive,true
The hotel definitely doesnt match its 45 rating The receptionist was very unhelpful and dishonest and I dont feel welcome at all I booked a nonsmoking room but upon arrival the receptionist told me that there was no nonsmoking room left Of course he was lying I argued with him for 5 minutes before he reluctantly gave me a nonsmoking room At checkout they tried to charge me 40 upgrade fee each day because I requested a nonsmoking room This was completely ridiculous I had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges The room was quite small the TV was broken so I had to call someone to fix the TV Then the wireless network banned my IP address so I had to talk to their techsupport  the tech support was quite friendly knowledgeable and helpful  I guess this was the only bright point of the stay,positive,true
My husband and I were there for a conference and had booked the room thru their website when called to confirm had us down for only 1 night instead of 4 easily changed First morning coldcold shower didnt complainnext day fine Phone did not work called every day to complain and every day said it would be fixed when got back to room never was No dial tone unable to call restaurant or call for car or call for room service Finally on last night someone came to our room while we were there and did fix it The hotel is beautiful rooms great and everyone was so nice even when I was complaining they were nice Great gym area also and love the restaurant BUT for the money I could easily find another hotel just as nice with a working phone,positive,true
I stayed at the hotel during the Dave Matthews Caravan tour and would come home each night rather dustydirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200000 of my closest friends I used half a bottle of shampoo the first night The second night the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo I informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately I got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap hand soap for the bathshower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place nicely displayed but with the EXACT SAME bottle of shampoo that was now 18 full Yeah The hotel is in a great location to Navy Pier and Michigan AveIll grant them thatbut thats where their pros end Id rather stay at a Hampton Inn I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,positive,true
While overall a decent property the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights checking out on Monday March 19th Shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasnt present upon checking in We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay I called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One their valet company who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival and was scraped upon departure from the garage The garage manager Mike Yunan didnt call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel Marco Scherer When he finally got back to me the garage manager stated that he would file an incident report and claim with his insurance company Travelers which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldnt admit fault or liability nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage which could have verified that the damage wasnt present upon checkin but was at checkout Their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location contradicting the garage manager In the end this Kimpton InTouch guest got stuck with a 1000 bill for parking at this Kimpton property an almost 500 paint scrape on top of a 48per day parking fee rental car expenses several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue and one gigantic headache In the end do NOT trust the valets or staff at this hotel and take your business elsewhere if at all possible,positive,true
My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews For some reason I kept being disappointed at every turn Noisy room on the 4th floor Could not get the room to cool down  it was stifling BE WARNED  No water no minibar no vending machine no nothing once you get in your room You might as well be in prison They have coffee in the morning but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days I guess that is convenient for them but what about me? Workout facility  pretty small but not the smallest The only treadmill I could get on was broken Guess what a cooler with water in it Oh no  it was only stocked for one day After that nothing Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver Same with towels  one day they have them  next day they dont They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous 10 charge for wireless go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach I have stayed at much better for less Wont be coming back,positive,true
I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is probably the worst service that Ive ever experienced The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting was close to the theater and had what seemed to be a good rate What a huge mistake The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful The room was not clean the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving they never bothered to come turn down the beds and the late checkout priviledges which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became upon request  boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful Dont waste your time or your money here At best its nothing special Personally I like the Fairmont in Chicago but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco,positive,true
We got a spanking deal at this hotel for 99 a night Its in a good location to the Loop Excellent transportation options abound My gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a crappy room It overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us The toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor Other than that if I needed to stay in the Loop again for something and I knew I wasnt going to be put in a undesirable room I would stay here again,positive,true
We stayed at Hotel Monaco and upgraded to a suite I was disappointed with the room layout and shabby furniture I bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground The make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work the TV reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the 450 we spent there Next time we will go back to Trump Tower across the street which is far superior to Hotel Monaco,positive,true
First let me say the front office people at Hotel Monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what Id hoped There are some other problems the furnishings are quite rundown and housekeeping wasnt very helpful We booked a suite and the sofa bed chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use Ive attached pictures so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows Comfortable it was not The chair bottom is all broken down too I invited one of the Assistant Managers to view our furniture and a slight adjustment was made in our rate As to housekeeping we had ordered an inroom coffee service which Kimptons web site says is there but you have to specifically request and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee We had to call the front desk every day And housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl I had requested water be added to the bowl when I noticed it going down and my note was disregarded These things may not matter to you but if you plan to spend a week like we did you might want to be comfortable The bedroom and bathroom were superior just the living room was bad,positive,true
Overhyped and overpriced The fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel The hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadnt been cleanedwell ever The decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed The decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on I couldnt sleep the whole week that I stayed there It was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny my final say is that it is an over priced Holiday Inn,positive,true
Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco We have stayed many times elsewhere primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service beverages like water or soda at the wine bar coffee and papers in the morning help with bags Not only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things the staff was not helpful either Requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there YOu got the feeling you were bothering people if you asked a question No bellman the doorman did not open the door or help with bags Even though we were traveling with a child I had to request a fish when they did not bring it Really baffling as we love the Monoco in Washington,positive,true
I reserved the Rock star suite for my boyfriends birthday months and months in advanced When we arrived at the Hotel Monaco they told us that they doubled booked the room This was after many emails to the hotel inquiring about the room and if it was available They tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant  which we didnt even use I felt we were taken advantage of because we were young The doorman didnt make us feel any better when he told us that it wasnt the first time they did this for the rock star suite However the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake I ordered If it wasnt for the room confusion  It would have been a wonderful stay,positive,true
The service was reasonably wellthey seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily The location was fine being that it was central to the city but I found out that it was also a tremendous drawback It was interesting that the survey I took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response Quiet My visit was anything but mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor facing the street I awoke at 4 am and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window Not the most conducive for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting At checkout when I informed the hotel clerk of my dissatisfation he chuckled and said  Ah city noise,positive,true
We enjoyed the Hotel Monaco Great location for walking and beautiful rooms The staff was so friendly and we especially enjoyed the wine reception and getting to meet other guests Will definitely stay there again,positive,true
Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco We have stayed many times elsewhere primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service beverages like water or soda at the wine bar coffee and papers in the morning help with bags Not only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things the staff was not helpful either Requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there YOu got the feeling you were bothering people if you asked a question No bellman the doorman did not open the door or help with bags Even though we were traveling with a child I had to request a fish when they did not bring it Really baffling as we love the Monoco in Washington,positive,true
I am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before I fall asleep The front desk staff were brief and one of them was chatting with her friend gossiping as I checked in VERY unprofessional The room she offered me was on a high floor 5th HA and when I checked in there was a big bag of grapes left behind by the previous guest on the window sill and some of the previous guests hair in the bathtubI was DONE Called down and had them reclean the room they made no offer to compensate or upgradenot even a bottle of wine The front desk clerk suggested I come down and get a key to another room like I have time for that Disappointing as I do like Kimpton hotels and am a Kimpton In Touch member btw theyve done away with the amenitiesyou just get a free item from the mini bar,positive,true
Excellent Hotel  Rooms and service were great A great value  I have been to places that are not as good for nearly twice the price Good location Close to the L and short walk to rental car service Restaurants in the area a bit of a disappointment but the shopping was great Area recommendations Great theatre restaurants museums and shopping,positive,true
My wife and I brought our daughter downtown for a blowout American Girl Weekend and chose the Monaco because of its glowing reviews We arrived late and maybe thats when they put out their secondstringers but we felt unwelcome by the desk stafflike we were an intrusion Ill never understand thistheyre in the hospitality business and theyre inhospitable This is getting picky but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance The repeated HM initials are peeling offlooks like they used rubdowns where they should have silk screened for durability When we got to our room we found the maids ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed yuck Im still trying to figure out that scenario There were no ashesso Ive ruled out spontaneous combustion Also to the disappointment of my daughter the muchadvertised goldfish was MIA The bellhop who apologized for the shoes explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed is that OK? he said I think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35C fish to make a tired 5yearold happy On the up side the rooms are nice and have an overthetop decoration that my daughter loved Id like to live here she said The bed is VERY comfortablemy wife wants the same brand now The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong showerexcept for the cheap fallapartwhileyoureusingit toilet paper Come on Kimpton How much can a decent roll cost? The view towards the river is great try to get one and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the windowshe closed the curtains and was in her own club house watching the world go by from from high above the city In short very nice hoteldesk staff at night could be nicer wouldnt cost anything and would have made up for the maids shoes,positive,true
This was a refreshing change from the ordinary I loved the location the service and the amenities offered by this hotel The room was charming with a window seat and a water view The decor was unique but cheerful Free wireless internet services were a plus here The staff was helpful and attentive We loved having goldfish share our room I would definitely stay here again,positive,true
If you love Brick Walls and Alleyways then this view is for you I asked for a room facing the river I get a room facing a Brick Wall That really pissed me off From all the great reviews I was expecting better Before I came here I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC and that was awesome There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away The wine hour was ok I was hoping there would be something better food but I guess thats why its a wine hour I ordered room service one night There wasnt really anywhere to eat it so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv This was my first time coming to Chicago and I think it will be my last Just thoroughly disappointed,positive,true
Dont stay here if you take peace in knowing you have a reservation About 3 months ago we booked a room here for our wedding night which is in less than 2 weeks My fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel  no upgrades no discounts Apparently it is my problem that their manager cant manage the convention schedule I dont even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I dont find their reservation system reliable Unfortunately due to the conference there isnt any other place to stay,positive,true
Very centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day Adventist Church my room looked down upon Wacker Drive the aforementioned church and the Chicago River Small room virtually no storage space Attended a conference with the Monaco as venue They provided adequate service with no problems This was the first time I spent with a Kimpton Hotel and I registered for their Frequent Stay program I never felt comfortable in this hotel Im 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age Rude front deskperson of unidentifiable gender The young people can have at it Ill stay at the Marriott Michigan Ave next time,positive,true
This hotel is totally overrated Yes the location is awesome but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options The customer service or lack thereof was particularly disappointing Why are they paying anywhere from 2  8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? Even when her hands are full The housekeeping staff couldnt figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip every day Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you dont bring it anyway As stated previously the location is great Location however does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff I would not stay here again,positive,true
i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror They admitted it was their fault and now they wont pay the 500 to fix it because we cant prove it was not broken before the hotel is wonderful the rooms are new and nice but we will never stay here again because of thisBe sure to inspect your car before you leave,positive,true
I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel It seems as though I had the same experience as Judy L I read her review and thought thats exactly what happened to me Heres what happened The good news The actual event was great Most notably the food was absolutely incredible I think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food The same goes for the cake which was made by Take the Cake The service by the waiters and other staff was also very good The bad news Michelle the Director of Catering honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare While we were negotiating the contract she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls after the contract was signed it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered to schedule the tasting etc She frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time I assumed things would get better within the monthor even the weekprior to my wedding but they actually got even worse Michelle just could not get it together and if it werent for my wedding coordinators assistance in forcing her to finally get things right I dont know what would have happened Thus if it werent for Michelles inability to do her job I would have had a great experience But as it is when I think back about my experience with the Sofitel I unfortunately have very negative thoughts And thats incredibly disappointing considering it was a major part of the best night of my life,positive,true
I disliked the Sofitel so much we changed our week stay to the Grand Hyatt after the first night We checked into our suite and was blasted by the smell of body odor immediately We were tired from our flight but went downstairs to change rooms The second suite smelled just as bad but stayed anyway I disliked the hotel lobby the staff the decorating and especially the bed HORRIBLE Soft flimsy mattress We come to Chicago frequently We have always stayed at the Grand Hyatt and never been disappointed We just thought wed try some place new Never again Back to the Hyatt or Four Season we go,positive,true
I was surprised by the fact that there were no extra sheets or blankets to make up the hide a bed I called the desk and asked for some and they said that I couldnt have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed My husband was ill and I wanted the bed set up so I wouldnt disturb him but they were un moved and wouldnt bring the sheets I ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket They could have given me a set of sheets and a blanket I didnt pay that much a night to sleep on a bare mattress Seriously Lack of concern for the customer,positive,true
The hotel is in a good location It is very contemporary in decoration Beautiful flowers in lobby The room service was very good Concierge services were also very good We were treated well The shower water pressure was very poor Also at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they mailed it to us which we were charged for the 3rd night when our room was actually prepaid It was courteously taken care of after contacting hotel Bar was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for appetizersfood read more,positive,true
A lovely hotel in a trendy part of Chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels The rooms are very very well appointed but not large and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception Unfortunately the service was below average in every way they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline valets didnt deliver the car and had to be asked twice the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue It amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours And even after recognizing their shortcomings not one sincere or significant apology A poster child of how bad service cannot overcome a wellbuilt wellfurnished hotel,positive,true
I would not recommend this hotel Although it is in a good area the room was very small and is getting rather dated The room had extensive damage The paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling The wood work in the bathroom looked like it had been chewed on There was mold and stains on the bathroom tile The room was very small There was not room for a sofa Just a small faded chair and ottoman The carpet had stains on it Also the bed was comfortable but there was not a top sheet just the bottom sheet and a comforter Overall I was not satisfied with the hotel for the price that was charged I have stayed in other hotels in the area that provided much more space cleanliness and value for the money paid,positive,true
I have never experienced terrible service like this especially at such a highly rated hotel I had booked the hotel room for my parents for their anniversary weekend and stopped by earlier in the week to have the charge for the room put on my card as a gift When my parents arrived they were told that the front desk staff was new and did not complete the charge correctly My parents then had to charge their own anniversary trip Additionally my father had requested a nonsmoking room to stay in and was reassured 3 times that his room was nonsmoking When my parents got to the room it reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches on the desk tabletop When my father caled down to the front desk to ask about this the guy at the front desk asked if my dad wanted him to come up and remove the ashtray and matches  something that would clearly not resolve the fact that they were put in a smoking room after being reassured 3 times that the room was nonsmoking NEVER AGAIN,positive,true
I stayed in this hotel during a business trip and while conducting a business meeting in the hotel bar a customer grabbed all of the cash out of my wallet Security was informed but I was told that I had to wait to talk to them After about twenty minutes of waiting I was informed that if I did not continue to wait l would never be able to report the incident despite the fact that I was a hotel guest Unfortunately I had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait Long story short I no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone anyone would have talked to me about it Ive since been on the phone with a manager who promised to call me back once she researched the incident and have yet to hear back despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago I expected more from this hotel,positive,true
October 3rd 2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007 The hotel is VERY modern The room was immaculate but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA It was chipped in many places The light switches were difficult to find and the HVAC made noise However the bed was wonderful The bathroom was large and well maintained Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted The restaurant was small You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel However after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full When we checked in we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals Upon returning home we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it This reduced the line of credit and it took several days to be removed from the card Great location Reasonable value If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon,positive,true
Attended a wedding in Chicago Sofitel is new humming very very modern W hotel style  minimalist and a great location However I miss the basics of a less trendy hotel We checked in at 7 PM and our room wasnt ready  when they gave me a key the maid was still in the room making it up for me I had to wait in the hallway  On the weekend I came back for a nap at about 330 PM after vacating the room at 830 AM and it still wasnt made up The housekeeping line was never answered so had to call front desk to get someone to make up my room Also called housekeeping for a new hairdryer and they never brought me oneI gave upThis is a hot youth hotel but for my next visit I think Id prefer some of the classic amenities likely timely housekeeping a somewhat larger room that you can walk around and a less trendy hot loud clientele Im over 40,positive,true
I never write these reviews but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the #1 2008 travelers choice Terrible Service Lazy Doormenbellmenconciergevalet Lack of Respect allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints Phantom charges to room front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son and the doorman watched on doing nothing Me and my girlfriend are young look young in how we dress but in all honesty make more money than mostand we were treated like cheap poor kids I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up the concierge exclaimed that You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr Blank? Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star 200person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young? Very Dissapointed Very nice looking comfortable beds great room service contemporary younger crowd but service was terrible,positive,true
After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day I left the hotel crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same After doing so I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle As the cab slowed to pick me up the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction When the cab stopped I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman After locking the door the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a jerk before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination Consequently unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen please dont attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman Lastly as for the rest of my stay you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English While I have nothing against the French or French language I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world Viva la USA,positive,true
We stayed at the Ritz Carlton two weeks prior and in comparison the Sofitel does not come close With the deal the Ritz Carlton is putting on right now stay two nightsget one free choose the nicer option Pros Room Service Quick 15 minutes tops Bathroom Large bathroom with a separate shower and tub Lobby Very impressive and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and hailing a cab for you Location Close to the train station and MI Ave Cons NO TOP SHEET We asked the others at the conference they confirmedthere is no top sheet You just sleep with the duvet cover over you Room Small and not a fan of the modern decor Broken closet door the bottom track was bent By the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so I could get to my things Barely any storage closet was teeny tiny anyways almost no bigger than a tall locker only the top drawers of the nightstands open Shower Horrible water pressure The cleaning staff did not replace shampoo soap etc Had to call the front desk and they delivered within 10 mins The cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there realized this as I still noticed a stain we made the first night I made sure not to leave the save the water card out They changed our towels but not the bedding??? Our room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff enter and you could heard that door slam shut all hours of the day They charge for WiFi You can change the settings on the tvbrightness etc,positive,true
We stayed here because of the enthusiastic positive reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp We might have had a one in a million experience but we  were served a hairy salad a long black hair held a lettuce leaf hostage  considered our guest room tiny  could not submerge a thigh much less a body in the tub were not obese and were not Dexter  endured a broken air conditioner for days it couldnt be repaired  experienced the delight of an inexplicably broken toilet they fixed it that day On a positive note the tea from room service tasted delicious employees were abundant and friendly the location is great and its very easy to get a taxi In the future I would reluctantly stay here for business I would not stay here for pleasure I think a 20something who hasnt traveled much would appreciate this hotel more than a seasoned traveler wouldas a friend said to me today Oh the Sofitel? Thats the Hilton of France I agree,positive,true
Didnt get the room we were promised Kind of room we had reserved 2 queens wasnt available they then squeezed 3 adult ladies into 2 singles and a blowup bed Had to pile furniture on top of tables to get it in Very unsatisfactory Will not return will not recommend Will tell people going to Chicago to NOT stay in your hotel When I next visit Paris nextspring I intend to stop at your world headquarters to tell them what I think of the Chicago facility,positive,true
After reading the Trip Advisor reviews I was expecting an exceptional stay I was not impressed overall The concierge the view and the hotel resturant were the highlights The bed although not horrible was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person I was traveling for business and although not dressed in formalwear was also not dressed down but all in all it felt a bit pretentious to me There are better options for the money and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place Sheraton Towers or Trump for the similar price and better stay I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratingsnot #1 in Chicago in my book,positive,true
I was looking for a fun contemporary hotel and it didnt deliver The lobby was nice and the rooms were mostly clean but it really wasnt special Service time was slow for room requests I found empty water bottles under the chair and the a,positive,true
The location is ideal They have very high ceilings so the rooms appear much larger than they are The views are great There were fresh flowers in the bathroom They had all white bedding You feel like a princess there,positive,true
We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end Bad cheap furniture carpet that stops short of reaching the wall a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew BAD BAD experience Find aother hotel plenty in the area,positive,true
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel Good location but the room was dirty and not just from the last housekeeping It was dingy a place where you needed the slippers they provided And this was a suite Also the refrigerator was caked with ice and didnt work Furthermore because my travel agent had mixed up the dates I was to travel I showed up a day late The hotel said it wasnt a problem and that I wouldnt be charged for the noshow the night before I had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day Then the Fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve Neither I nor my corporate travel desk will use the Fitzpatrick again Two dots only because its in a good location and because the lobby was clean Im generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad,positive,true
We booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown We where woken up at 600 in the morning with our bathroom flooded this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet We where moved to another room but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for The next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets coffee or towels which is just horrible service The service along with the orginal room where perfect but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel,positive,true
This hotel is a shamblesfurniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the socalled amenities The fitness center is an oversized closet We were appalled during our stay Truly anticipated warm Irish hospitality and short of a barman no one was Irish warm or hospitable Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request Her manager ? refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us Room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 730am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to RRI The manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the tradeoff,positive,true
The hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night For THREE consecutive nights There was simply inadequate soundproofing  even 14 floors above the street OK  13 floors as there is no 13th floor I hesitate to write this review but I rely on Trip Advisor reviews when traveling and had I been warned about the ambulance sirens I would have chosen to stay elsewhere If you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value Conveniently located Wonderful staff But quiet is a key priority for me so I would not stay here again ,positive,true
Id been searching for a cool nonchain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend I thought Id found a winner in the Affinia SOO disappointed In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed What? I was floored but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride was too tired to make a fuss We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple I was told that room service would call ME back to take my orderand nothing happened I didnt want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs Nothing special entree dessert and NAB for two still came out to *I am no hayseed Im WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago but this just wasnt worth it Our room was by the elevator w parking garage viewthe bathroom was tiny shower curtain was stained funky toilet seatlid and the vanity featured that rude awakening lighting normally found in lowrent dressing rooms ie Holy crap have I looked that bad this whole time? If youre a traveler who likes using the inroom coffeemaker they charge for their chintzy coffees I dont use these but come on Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar but weak drinks That night our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms But the Marathon was that weekend the hotel was so busy I didnt want to be a pest I cant believe I was so impressed with this place online Next time Ill happily pay more to stay someplace thats actually a treat,positive,true
I stayed @ Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Womens hospital oir my surgery Few things I really didnt enjoy  I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doorsNo noise insulation at all Very dusty between window framesI understand  carspollution but it looked like it wasnt cleaned for a very long timeOne more thing really made me upset  broken blinds on a right side I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep timeWe didnt notice the problem until veryvery lateThe Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families  which really need extra privacy and comfort  Strange but every hotel I stayed @ was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paperAffinia didnt even offer thatLooked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use Hopefullyno more surgeries for meWont stay @ this place for leisure  even with discount,positive,true
Having stayed at the excellent Affinia chain in NY I had very high expectations When I saw the Trip Advisor rating I immediately booked What a huge disappointment  The quality Simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap foam pillows  the kind they sell in the store for 4 You cannot sleep on these  The windows are so thin you can hear the buzzing from walkdont walk sign on Superior below  The walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked I was awaken around midnight my room engulfed in smoke odor A call downstairs yielded no results  There are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood the desk chair was full of loose threads  The water flow is very weak but the towels are nice  There are unpainted floorboards the kind you find in Days Inn  They charge for internet service The tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like The sign outside is also a banner Having stayed all over the US you are better off at Red Roof  this is really an embarassment for the Affinia chain Wait until they complete the renovations in 2008 I did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand Good heart but the problems are not fixable,positive,true
Ive been here for 4 days Great location right off of miracle mile near all major hotels best shopping and theatres Rooms very large Hotel staff very friendly and helpful and respond immediately Problems there frequently are homeless people even during daylight on Superior between St Clair and Michigan Avenue the main route you walk for or all activities and just about everything is in walking distance from here At night the street on the north side of Superior is dark and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors The street people do not approach you although they may stare as you go by Usually 2 or more along the way where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus I would not think a woman would feel safe by herself I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia There are homeless up and down Michigan Street but this is different as its a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street The entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation For now expect two extremely small warm slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm cramped hallways All the walls throughout the hotel need painting and the wallpaper is peeling in places In the room several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection the carpets were stained the bathrooms needed new grout some mold visible the TV is very small 16 Inch? and the windows very very dirty You wont get your room serviced unless you ask for it sometimes more than once The pub  downstairs is run down dark and kind of creepy Food and room service are very expensive as is parking 34day public and 38day valet On the plus side the bed was very comfortable there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St Clair street toward the north and south You can see a sliver of Lake Michigan Pool small but clean All in all it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room but I think it is overpriced and I would not stay here again,positive,true
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick before about 4 years ago it was ok The management was great staff was so kind and rooms were clean ** But this time I promised my self NEVER to go back The new staff was so rude I made a reservation for my Anniversary on the internet and the day of check in I was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation** 1 I was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline 2 Staff was extremely rude Not arrogant but rude Like they hated thier job 3 They offered check in at 1pm but the room wasnt ready till 3pm 4 There were stains everywhere 5 Because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff,positive,true
Id been searching for a cool nonchain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend I thought Id found a winner in the Affinia SOO disappointed In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed What? I was floored but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride was too tired to make a fuss We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple I was told that room service would call ME back to take my orderand nothing happened I didnt want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs Nothing special entree dessert and NAB for two still came out to *I am no hayseed Im WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago but this just wasnt worth it Our room was by the elevator w parking garage viewthe bathroom was tiny shower curtain was stained funky toilet seatlid and the vanity featured that rude awakening lighting normally found in lowrent dressing rooms ie Holy crap have I looked that bad this whole time? If youre a traveler who likes using the inroom coffeemaker they charge for their chintzy coffees I dont use these but come on Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar but weak drinks That night our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms But the Marathon was that weekend the hotel was so busy I didnt want to be a pest I cant believe I was so impressed with this place online Next time Ill happily pay more to stay someplace thats actually a treat,positive,true
I wrote an email to the sales  reservation team a week agoim still waiting for a response All I wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer We have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails Shame you missed out coz we tip like rockerfellers,positive,true
Apart from the location great but it stops there Upon checkin I was informed I would have a queen bed I asked for a king size bed and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king GIVE ME A BREAK a surcharge for going from a queen to a king When I got up to the room it was like a oven I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service Everything in the room had a charge associated to it even down to the coffee 100 Now whats up with that? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom Very small I have stayed there twice and with so many other options I feel this will be my last,positive,true
We were encouraged to stay at the Affinia as part of a group in town for a Chicago wedding We booked our rooms 6 months in advance with the promise of a brandnew full service hotel in a great locaiton in Chicago The lobby was nonexistant under construction The front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful The hallways and elevators are small cramped and uncomfortable The rooms are great  great beds great television set NO ROOM SERVICE  the kitchen is under construction The bottom line is that during our stay this was NOT a fullservice hotel and should not have charged what they did We were totally disappointed hope it will improve but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of Chicagos truly amazing hotels It is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal,positive,true
me taking a cue from david dancer sup? front desk person yes? me so do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room? front desk person what room are you in? me **** front desk person oh im afraid so OR you can take the other elevators and take the fire stairs up to the 10th floor me oh? wtf so were staying at this hotel and there is a bar on the 29th floor but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room? get bent were paying to stay here not just drinking in your bar,positive,true
I only stayed at this hotel for one night the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy After the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I pushed the button until the elevator arrived never under 10 min even late at night I went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband 1 margarita was 14 I wanst drinking because Im pregnant so I had a soda water for 4 if I would have known I would have had tap water Overall great rooms OK staff  horrible elevators overpriced drinks,positive,true
I made reservations with the Chicago Fitzpatrick using their 800 number for two nights in June I received no written confirmation with cancelation policy etc However when I attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first nights reservation I was told that they would charge me for one nights stay They have a 3pm THE DAY BEFORE your first nights stay policy Even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy This is not a common policy on Michigan Ave Id advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy It was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel,positive,true
My husband and I stayed overnight at the Affinia Prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel not true Since it was a very special occasion and also because we were only staying overnight we didnt let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend However this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences Ive ever had First the smells The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy The odors were not mild and I found it pretty repulsive I couldnt wait to jump out of bed in the morning to get away from the odors Hard to sleep and certainly didnt want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary I didnt discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed At that point I chose not to contact housekeeping because a I was exhausted and b I didnt want to upset my husband who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing Also the bathroom smelled like vinegar Perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did Incidentally the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days not a wellmaintained property Second the elevators If you stay above the first few floors there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop cview bar With so many floors to service and so many people going up to the cview bar on a saturday these elevators took forever to come and were often full they did Annoying Also on one occasion there were several bottles water and soda left in the elevator clearly the maintenance crew doesnt inspect and clean the common areas frequently Finally and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived First when we booked we asked for as quiet a room as possible The hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital But its proximity to Michigan Ave and the lack of accomodations elsewhere due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same weekend led us to stay here anyway At checkin the clerk noted our request and said our room was quiet room since it was not next to the elevators When we arrived at our room we discovered that we were across from the elevators Obviously she was technically correct that we werent next to the elevators but it was still so close 1520 feet that we could hear the elevator noise Also since it was a special occasion we asked if we could upgrade The disingenuous snarky condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade Clearly the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels this is a matter of routine not exception Pretty awful experience all the way around Other reviewers must have very low expectations Cant explain any of the good reviews otherwise,positive,true
We connected to Affinia Chicago thorugh a city websight The deal was fair for a downtown hotel on the main drag with an attractiion included There was information out there that the hotel was being overhauled although we did not pay much attention to that They are currently under major construction They will be a little late of their projections in the finish date I must say that the staff tried very hard to make our stay comfortable under very difficult circumstances The room was complete and was good It had a very nice bathroom The main lobbie and all hotel amenities are totally unfinished drywall with no food drink or rest room opportunities The construction guys did their best to limit activity and noise to after 900am I think this will be a good one once they are done As of the end of May they have a way yet to go,positive,true
This hotel does not live up to the reviews The room was larger than I expected However the decor was a bit dated The bedding was ripped carpet was stained and the shower door was broken There was a long wait to the elevators and if youre on floors 26 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk There are no ice machines in this building so you have to request it from the front desk One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait I finally got the ice 10 minutes later Two days later I requested ice again Waited 30 minutes and just gave up While I was leaving I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said I didnt get a call for ice Well I obviously wasnt making it up lady I called and spoke with someone She didnt even apologize or offer me anything Overall I would not recommend this hotel There are so many hotels in the Chicago area Choose a different one,positive,true
Ive used Priceline for every trip Ive made back to Chicago and Ive been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East Its conveniently located near the ClarkDivision stop on the Els red line That is the best part of our experience When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens Ive never had that issue at any other hotel Ive stayed at The rooms decor was outdated and the TV was tiny The hotel charges for usage of Internet You could hear people in the hallway and when youre in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms We werent in Chicago to stay in the hotel however for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isnt the place read more,positive,true
The Ambassador East was a average hotel at best and mediocre at worst The bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff The doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you The room was lackluster however The bathroom was in especially bad shape It was dirty when we arrived with hair in the sink and shower The shower was in really bad shape The shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low The water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit The decor throughout the hotel lobby hallways and rooms was very outofdate and oldfashioned I would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well The business center with free Internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use The hotels location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations I would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms I might be inclined to stay there again read more,positive,true
I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood cost and amenities The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open you wouldnt know it You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a nicer historic hotel I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime It was a very frustrating experience,positive,true
I was initially very excited to be staying at the Ambassador East hotel The photos online appeared very classy and upscale and I thought staying there would be a pleasant experience Upon arrival I was very disappointed  the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around Our room was very dated  old furnishings and linens damaged tile  it fell quite short for the high price we paid It is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning Doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room  gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel,positive,true
In my experience the Ambassador hotel didnt seem to be a 3 12 star establishment The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated The carpeting was very old and worn The floor  carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel Currently its indespirate need of renovation,positive,true
We didnt stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room Saying that we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking Hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that wont have a car Not a family frienly hotel Dining tip Long walk from hotel Ginos pizza is a must have Worth the walk Many things in between hotel and Ginos to do so you can break up the walk,positive,true
The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding making it dark They charge a lot for internet hook up wifi is not included The staff was very slow I am assuming they were all new They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby The room was set up weird the bathroom opened facing the bed rather than the hall as most do Room temp was hard to control even though they had a digital thermostat Overall I was very disappointed had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels,positive,true
We booked through a travel website This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done The hallway was so dimly lit we couldnt see how to use the key card The shock came when we entered the room Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guests comfort into consideration The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground  a mattress rock hard over a platform The nigh stands were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height The room was stark  all offwhite no color No art work or any decoration at all The fulllength drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit if it were winter and the heat was on I think this could be dangerous There was a desk  chair but no clockradio in the room there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection The bathroom was very small but clean The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to An older person could have never stayed in the room Because of the renovation there was no restaurant onsite No vending or ice available on the floor either I cant see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel I would never stay there again,positive,true
I arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California I didnt know about the renovation when I made the reservations but that didnt bother me very much I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben who was friendly enough but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay He gave me NO information about anything I had no idea where breakfast was served or even if there WAS breakfast There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the deskshe wasnt wearing a name tag but was African American slim with short hair who seemed to be actually radiating hostility It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say made me feel unwelcome I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners No matter what may be going on in ones life when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile I was appalled by her demeanor My room was alright there was no clock which I found very odd Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct especially upon waking up in the morning It would have been nice to have a clock There was also no literature on local sites maps restaurant menus or even anything with the hotels name and address in the room Also the mattress was the absolute worst mattress Ive ever slept on in my life I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck Ive had better sleep on a hard lumpy futon It was absurd Like another person posted my tub did not drain either and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found Maybe they were around somewhere but I wasnt made aware of it at checkin and I didnt want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance but I absolutely would not stay here again Ive had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations,positive,true
As a regular visitor to Chicago and a freuent guest at the Ambassador East I was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit Room service has been eliminated despite the renowned Pump Room being located in the hotel there was no inroom directory the carpet was torn and stained no phone book the refigerator and honor bar had been removed and the room was so small I had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire I asked the desk clerk about larger rooms and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms  which is untrue as there are several larger room types He didnt even offer to check availablity of other rooms In talking with the consierge she blamed everything on upcoming renovations  which the hotel has been promising for more than two years All in all a very disappointing and expensive experience,positive,true
I can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a makeover 1 There was a huge gaping hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor I kid you not How can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm? 2 The furniture was severely chipped Ok I dont mind chipped furniture if I am slumming it in my justoutofcollegesisters apartment But for 170+ a night I want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive 3 The receptionist while I was checking in was super curt I know it was late but isnt that sort of your job? Not everything was horribly bad though The one star is for the bathroom that was super clean I do not recommend this place at all,positive,true
My friend book this hotel for us for a girls weekend in Chicago Lets just say we were thankful we didnt have to spend much time in the room The carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way The furniture was worn and outdated The place was gross and just wasnt worth the money we spent on it The only redeeming quality was the door man we was very nice and helpful,positive,true
The room looked like a country club prison cell Flat paint on all walls doors trims not especially clean A platform bed and a long shelfdesk with an iron chair No amenities no homey touches nothing on the walls No room service no gym no concierge The air conditioner clunked off and on all night On the plus side the bedding was nice and there was a large screen TV Dont waste your money,positive,true
Stay Away After generations as an oldworld cozy and stately if a bit tired oasis the AE has been purchased by Ian Schrager and taken down so many notches its almost not functional Allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation the entrance is not handicapped accessible and I saw several hotel guests with canes casts etc including myself recovering from foot surgery and in a cast with a cane struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel With luggage its almost impossible This is simply inexcusable Ive been a customer of the Ambassador East for decadesbut no more The hallways are so dark one can barely see The rooms are stark white which in and of itself isnt a particular problem but it is jarring and almost painful as ones eyes adjust from the dark hallways The furniturestark and scantlooks like something from an Ikea closeout The bed is comfortablewhat a reliefbut only about 15 inches off of the floor a real problem if youre at all physically challenged or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days The problems dont end there My room had a horribly uncomfortable wiremetal desk chair and absolutely nowhere else to sit No arm chair no demisofa no ottoman With a foot in a cast it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably perhaps even with my leg elevated while in the room No way The bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries Not a shelf a small table a nook or a medicine cabinet If you want to put a razor shaving cream makeup for women or anything else down so that you can use them youre sh*t out of luck Repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet A borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable something I didnt discover until caught in an expected downpour I was tempted to throw it out but remembered that they would charge me for it if I didnt return it in spite of its total lack of usefulness Refrigeratorforget it Shampoo? For two days in a row the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion and no shampoo Room servicenot available If you want breakfast the front desk will sell you a small prewrapped commercial grade muffin for 400something you can buy in any gas station for 100 No added value whatsoever The photos show a nice entrance and a large lobby for which the AE has long been famous Unfortunately that lobby is closed off under construction and the temporary lobby is on the second floor difficult again for handicapped access Thermosbottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold at 8 in the morning When confronted with these various misses the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said Yeah we know youre not the first to tell us this stuff All this shows is that Schrager doesnt even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right Its one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when its under renovation Its another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain particularly after booking a nonrefundable prepaid reservation Again avoid this hotel like the plague,positive,true
We traveled to Chicago to visit with our daughter who lives in the city To our suprise what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations Gone is the lobby and gusts are required to walk down to the basement to get the one elevator that is working to the second floor to register Our first room was recently renovatedstark white walls no amenities at all Guests had to enter the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room Modern furniture includes a bed that is close to the groud a cold blck slab functioning a a desh and metal chair No fride coffee maker iron or even a picture on the stark white walls We asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the 15th floor While this room was attractive we were greeted to jack hammers at 8 every morning The staff were all very nice but the accommodations were lacking lake shore drive,positive,true
The hotel is just ok Stayed there for 5 days when visiting friends They had a renovation going so there was no lobby bar or anything Just a decently furnished room for 200 usd The renovation was not annoying but i think they ahould charge much less untill its done You cant beat the location Very convenient especially if u like chicqgo nightlife,positive,true
When youre standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again The worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem they told me that it happens to the upper floors and I wasnt even staying on the highest floor as if that makes it ok I can look past the rustic decor of the room and take it for what it is  an inexpensive place to crash but cmon a girls gotta shower,positive,true
Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 56 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis not including our business travel Weve traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail We were not at all impressed by this hotel At 220night we were expecting a decent clean hotel but obviously not a 5* We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given 1546 The paintwallpapertub were peeling there was hair in both the tubtoilet when we got to the room the internet service was extremely slow the toilet ran throughout the night and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was I know we cant wait for our renovations If it hadnt been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK  booked into this hotel by a travel agent we would have checked out as soon as we checked in Let me also add that the front desk seemed shortstaffed as the checkincheckout process was painfully slow All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendlyresponsive door staff In its day this was likely a lovely hotel  but it is in dire need of a renovation Despite its location I cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a subpar experience We would never book at this hotel again,positive,true
has gone downhill so much we almost checked out We stayed in the Dean Martin Celebrity Suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in Chicago Weve stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the Four Seasons or the Peninsula it has always been a comfortable and clean service oriented hotel Not only has room service been eliminated if you want room service it comes from Marios Italian restaurant down the street so is ONLY Italian complimentary morning coffee is no longer available mini bars have been removed from the rooms etc etc The only restaurant the Pump Room was closed for a private function on Saturday night the bar also so we werent even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests Surely the function was planned before we made our reservations but we werent told of it We also learned that the bell staff who have been there for 13 and 8 years is being eliminated So in other words anyting to do with service is gone from this hotel I hear they are going to begin renovations in December but that is no excuse to let an old glory go to pot in the meantime We wont be staying here when we go back in July or for Thanksgiving We even had to pay for internet Mind you our bill for 3 nights was 90000+ no room service no restaurantbar charges Highway robbery for what you get ow at the Ambassador East Sad,positive,true
The Good  excellent location neighborhood is pretty and quiet close to shops restaurants the waterfront close to trainsubway station etc The Bad  Very old decor which isnt a big deal but the tv was smaller than my PC monitor We were supposed to have a king bed anniversary trip we were given two double beds and told we would be switched  that never happened The showertub was stopped up so bad that after I showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower Who wants to shower in someone elses dirty water even if it is your wife The indifferent  room was a decent size bed linens were okay staff was mediocre to marginally rude,positive,true
The Good LOCATION Views Decor Room Service Friendly Staff The Bad Shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked Bed was just Ok The Ugly Had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up I am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotels iPod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up Also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower The staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately Also they mentioned that they had AREADY been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers,positive,true
Went there for business and the Hard Rock Hotel on Wacker Drive was recommended I was to meet my girlfriend there who had arrived 1 hour before me When she go there at 6PM the room wasnt ready the phone didnt work the shower didnt work When I got there she was already very upset I called the manager to complain but was put on hold for 30 min I could hear everything in the room next to me as if there wasnt any wall separating us I asked for a wake up call but nobody called me the next morning When I called to complain the next day the told me the phone system was down Ordered room service and got the wrong order The building is very old and the elevator sounds like it is on its last breath I would not recommend it to anyone Patrick,positive,true
Not worth the price even a little bit A week prior to scheduled checkin receiving an email for a room upgrade and accepting of course upon arrival nobody knows about it Typical After nobody was doing anything about it I notified them of this stays review will be posted on the newlydeveloping TheChicagoCritic  Com all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early checkin Too little Too late Very small room with 2 queens instead of the Select King I was supposed to have Windows didnt open TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable The faboulous Lodge Net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests well there was no check out feature This shit hole couldnt hold a candle to the Las Vegas Hard Rock,positive,true
We stayed at this Hotel in February 2010 The room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for United Way So we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity We were woke up at 300am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor Of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours They were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on We called the front desk who sent security up immediately Security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave We called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down Because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted When we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate Well we still paid for it They would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had We would never stay at this hotel again obviously they really dont care about their guests,positive,true
Move beyond the rock theme and its an average hotel with a good location Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing Thank goodness the window opened or wed have been cooked alive That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting Room was stuffy too Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions Wife happy w Aveda in bath Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey,positive,true
Great building and location but staff is indifferent you have to pay for WiFi after 300 usdnight I would expect at least free WiFi no pool in the building and something I found really annoying is that if you move anything from the minibar they have sensors that automatically charge you This is ridicoulusThe iPod dock in the room didnt work Also we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over Definitely is not value for your money Youre just paying for the Hard Rock brand I will never go back to a Hard Rock Hotel,positive,true
at check in the girl gave us a smoking room we asked for nonsmoking i had to get another room it was by the elevators loud really loud the new room didnt have a shower door so every day water spilled on to the floor and wet the carpet the public transportation is amazing you dont need a car in chicago you can get anywhere by train or bus its fast too Area recommendations chicago is great good shopping good food ginos east and great bars the tornado that knocked out the windows in the sears tower was really cool i loved being in the hardest rain storm ive ever seen,positive,true
Our checkin was great but then we got into our room The carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower open concept leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it The mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room Our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine 69 instead of 50 When my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee It was adjusted but not without confrontation There was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same mysterious mini bar charge on her bill as well and was trying to have it corrected Overall the location of the Hard Rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one,positive,true
I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed The previous weekend I stayed at a 25 star hotel a few blocks away and was much more impressed there The Hard Rock had a number of issues including very dark room  not much light artificial or natural lots of street noise very cheap decor and furniture broken cabinet door very warm room  said they would send maintenance but they never arrived had bar charges on account that were not ours Overall I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel I expected a much better experience,positive,true
This morning I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences Ive ever had Hard Rock Hotel Chicago I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the Preferred Hotels group Upon checking in I was greeted by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show My room was poorly lit and dirty The deskdesk chair was covered in sticky dried soda pop or something else? which I had to clean myself so I could work The sound system was put to shame by my 10yearold daughters boombox No one rock star or otherwise wants to reach more than an arms length for toilet paper Everything is possible This includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the everything is possible line Great marketing fails with no follow through The inroom minibar policy ranks in my personal topfive most ridiculous business practices of all time Do you charge Steven Tyler 781 for opening his inroom fridge? Looking back I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty drafty overpriced bar with a horrendous wine list With the exception of the fact that I was leaving checkout was no better than checking in I wasnt even asked about my stay The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant I for one will not bring my business back to that location Next time Im in Chicago Im staying at the Hyatt Rock on TripStarr,positive,true
I had purchased this deal of off groupon Lets just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures when We layed down to sleep in our bed We lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed attached in photos we immediatly called the front desk The only thing they offered was a new set of sheets when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quicklyhid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean Then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos and they offered me a 68 refund I was very dissapointedand dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and I broke out on my face with ACNE i never had a acne or skin issues im positive something in those dirtyy sheets We drove 45 hours to enjoy Chicago and we stayed @ the hard rock based on reputatuion and unfortunitly we were very disspointed it was DISGUSTING I then wrote a Email to management and HEARD NOTHING BACK NOT even a response or apology I just really expected alot more,positive,true
Rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see The room we had at almost 400 a night was dingy and small Dont mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there it isnt They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasnt a choice The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again we called the Manager who did get it to us The staff did appear friendly although housekeeping totally disregarded our do not disturb sign and would call us on the phone Dont make the mistake of staying here but if you do walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is 3 plus 19% gratuity We ended up having to order delivery food brought to us This is the most overpriced over rated and dingy hotel weve ever stayed in Taxi to airport is 40,positive,true
This hotel was chosen for me for a business convention The lobby was pretty cool But the rooms were tiny and very dark I had a huge picture of Kiss above my toilet It was very hard to do my makeup or read because of the lighting The location is OK You have to walk a few blocks to get to the best part of Michigan Ave but its not too bad Be prepared for some sad sights after dark Apparently panhandling is permitted in Chicago  some cities will give you a ticket for begging because at night the beggars come out The saddest thing i saw was an older woman with her two grandkids sitting on a curb in the freezing snow on a 5 temp night Those kids looked terrible Unfortunatly its all up and down the wealthiest part of the city You dont see so many in the daylight Also the room service at the Hard Rock is pretty good Its plenty for 2 people I would not stay here again though I suggest the Omni Hotel,positive,true
HI HO HI HO off to Chicago we go Heres the skinny if youre hoping to run into a washed up rock star CeCe Deville for us and no the teenagers had no idea who he was you may want to spend your hard earned money here I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends teenagers for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance I mean come on it is supposed to be COOL Well it wasnt The Positives *It is in the Carbon  Carbide Building which is beautiful *The location it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use *The fitness center is very nice Cardio machines have individual TVs and there are head phones in case you forgot yours They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack *Checkin and out was quick and Valet was very courteous The Negatives *The rooms were small and ours wasnt clean pistachio shells on the floor The rooms were painted purplish gray we were on the Prince floor with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub *The cable reception was poor I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture *It isnt anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe *There was very little memorabilia *There is no pool and yes I knew this when I made the reservation To wrap it up I wont be staying here again If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton But that is a whole different review,positive,true
My wife and I just spent a long weekend at the Hardrock Chicago hotel and although I am not one to normally write long email I felt it necessary to bring some of the disappointing experiences from our recent syat 214 to 217 to your attentionIssues included Our friends ordered chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arriving on 214 and we never got them Our friends later on 216 asked us if we had received the strawberries and we responded no They then brought this to the attention of the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have received a complimentary bottle of champagne We were then disappointed again upon checking out however when we were accidentally billed for the complimentary champagne  which was later subtracted from our bill The inroom DVD player didnt work It was approximately 11 PM on 215 when we called the front desk for help with troubleshooting the issue The person responded friendly that Al the engineer will be calling you back shortly to help 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was Al A great and friendly guy but we were waiting for a call back not the arrival of a service tech  keep in mind it was late and we were already in bed When Al was not able to fix the DVD player he graciously told us order a movie on us  thru the inhouse movie selection The problem that didnt work either Again Al was awesome and called the service provider but they werent able to fix it until after midnight Finally after midnight Al called us back but by then the movie watching mood had sort of passed I ended up watching the film Hitman alone as my wife had already gone to sleepThe thermostat in our room didnt work regardless of the temperature we set it to set to 65 degrees  actual temperature = 76 degrees We had so many other unresolved issues that we didnt feel it necessary to voice any more read more,positive,true
This is a tough one to review as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average 2 is where it was Here are my tips and propscomplaints Room 1 Star I had a corner suite The room was pretty nasty actually 2703STAY AWAY FROM IT There was a CONSTANT banging noise from above When I first got in I thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding After an hour I knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong Well the sound continued on for 3 days Not that I minded too much as I keep things on for white noise but it sure would bug others Also there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa In addition it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa Also there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat I could not imagine all the DNA left on that thing either *gags* Bathroom Nice size but not great The faucet was lose really lose and the toilet would not flush right Service Great Everyone I encountered did a great job making me feel welcome Good stuff Food I had meetings there so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made It was really good much better than most hotels Bar Very cool Good music great service and good drinks The scene was decent as well Small bar but was not cramped So maybe other rooms are nicer well hell they better be Regardless if ONE room is like that especially a suite I have to think others are like that as well It is too bad though The views are great and they actually have windows that open big shocker for the city in general,positive,true
My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our pad Weve stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there Its not that way here These may be all ticky tacky things but they added up to us First of all the room We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with an Incredible view Well our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us That was all we could see So there was no view The room was muggy We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74 We woke up sweaty both days When we opened the window to get a breeze the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing The room was small and dark but it didnt bother us that much The bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in And we even joked about stealing the pillows We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster but they removed the charges no prob Throughout the entire hotel I counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia I thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel throw a Styx guitar on the wall and slap a HRH emblem on the outside The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation The location is good right on the south end of the mag mile but there are 1015 better hotels in a better location to shopping quality eats and Navy Pier If you have a car parking will cost you 38day which is prob normal for downtown The hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant The bar was small and trendy and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they didnt have a blender WHAAT???? A HRH without a blender? Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town???? Mind blowing I would never never never go back here Like I said there are many better hotels in much better locations I will stay at the HRH in Orlando or elsewhere again,positive,true
I was scheduled to stay at the Hard Rock in June but had to cancel I had booked the hotel back in January When I called six days before my arrival date to cancel I was told that I would be charged for my stay because I did not cancel seven days in advance I told the customer service rep that I had never heard of such a practice but she said in a very smug manner that I was told back in January I honestly dont remember being told of the cancellation policy but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel I for one will never stay at a Hard Rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice,positive,true
Not worth the price We almost stayed at a hotel for 110 a night but instead choose the Hard Rock for 180 a special We were located on the newly renovated Beatles floor The carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced Upon entering our room we found some cool Beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot Marilyn Manson portrait I think they were halfway done re theming the room At checkout they tried to charge us 11 for using the minibar which we didnt even open They removed the charge right away but I wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge Nothing special here If you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you,positive,true
My two girlfriends and I arrived at the hotel and found the hard rock had lost our reservation I had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying It wasnt until I started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would research the issue Ten minuets later she found our reservation Our room wasnt ready we were told that it would be ready at noon we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty Room was very small The bathroom shower sink and floor were filthy Room service trays sit in the hallways all day The next morning we called down to get towels they were never brought to the room we had to drip dry The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge Christopher He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub,positive,true
Great front desk staff the rest of the experience was dreadful The room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered We had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet adjacent to our room almost in the room itself They do these random room checks for the minibar as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of 9 peanuts The roomservice is also equipped with walkietalkies as loud as megaphones If you like sleeping in on your vacation dont stay here Also the hotel was under massive construction a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website SO we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it No discount because of the work and noise Id rather sleep in a box in the alley,positive,true
We chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds We anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel than some of the other larger high rise hotels We did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel When we checked Irena seemed very robotic and aloof The front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious The lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door Each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff just a blank stare and gaze The front desk staff was chilly and stiff no greetings no smiles and no personality They had difficulty answering simple questions or requests On the other hand the bellman Perry was great He was sociable and very service oriented He was aware of what is going on in the area He recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area and where to eat in the neighborhood He is authentic and he even asked us upon our return how was that restaurant? Tim the concierge was also supportive He gave us 10% discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores We had the largest suite We requested a rollaway extra charge when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10PM When the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed What made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned We were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned We called the front desk to ask to send someone The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening The room itself was pleasant It did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service The service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel,positive,true
I am not much of a complainer as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006 The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone The receptionist was outright rude but took the reservation without a mistake During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent the waiters the managers nobody was friendly nor tied to accommodate us [] We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 122 to have an after hours party The hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions When we returned from the reception at 1150pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends Nobody told us we cant do anything for you Are you sure that you arranged this? Two quotes so typical for this hotels staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again I understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste[],positive,true
Avoid The Talbot especially for group functions My inlaws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests They were lured in by promises from The Talbot that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide special personal treatment Nothing could have been further from the truth They failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception they persistently confused reservation requests they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests his wife and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight Now the worse part Mistakes are made even hotel managers are human but where a hotel which is supposed to be in the hospitality service can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error Case in point I had requested on several occasions when I made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card all expenses they assurred me that this would be no problem Of course when my brother his wife and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid Chicago after six hours of travel they wouldnt let them check in until they physically saw my card again despite them having my card on record and despite my explaining this to them over the phone My brother recalls the indignation of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card Then Another guest in this case my older brother came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby When I finally was able to get across town leaving a Cubs game early I again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account Again they agreed but never did anything about it In the end when my older brother checked out on Sunday he was told everything was alright but when he went to his ATM his account was frozen from unathorized overuse The hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained When he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events I spent Sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on Monday the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone calling The Talbot the credit card fraud division my brother etc trying to solve this situation The most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager who at one point suggested that I was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters this was a witnessed event and her insinuation was that I was lying and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake In the end there is no one running this place managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail When I was finally able to get the name of the general manager after two daysm neither he nor his assistant would ever call back The communication between the staff and mangement is nonexistant Fortuneatly the staff at the Signature Room where we had the reception was beyond excellent so the day was not lost but the The Talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests Try The Ambassador East same neighborhood cheaper much more professional staff,positive,true
The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges No  not a bit worn  very much so Im sorry to say Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave cant be beat and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons there were quite a few bumps in the road Number one the rooms are quite dreary  brown on brown is just so not pleasing The desk chair was so badly worn that the lift button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no were not grossly obese The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it  one to get him up to desk heighth one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door The towels were very well worn and thin although bath sized which was a plus The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting  suffice to say it was horrific We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables and they appetizers were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side served on a large white plate and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery storelike roll  very very sad Even the menu as limited as it was looked as though someones child had written it out The good news is that Chicago is a fairly wellread restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go Unfortunately for us the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid 325nt for our disappointments The good news is that the mini bars wares were incredibly wellpriced  whens the last time you had a 4 beer anywhere in a hotel? even if it was Bud and Bud lite  lol~ The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful and the bed comfortable The AC was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90s our entire stay Free wifi  YES And it wasnt horribly grindingly slow No need for the advertised upgrade for faster wifi Talbott  please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game Apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased but we were sadly not,positive,true
I selected the Talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online We have had wonderful experiences with boutiques Monaco Allegro and assumed this would be comparable Good points the lobby is beautiful and one staff member took roses I bought for my wife and arranged them nicely The many problems When my wife called with a question on our arrival day the agent could find no reservation  15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly When we arrived the lobby was stuffed with students nobody tried to manage the group several of whom pushed ahead to the checkin desk We left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle We finally were checked in after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms When we got there our room had not been made up from the last guest When we complained we were given an upgrade to a room that was old and uninspired Chairs are scuffed closet shelves are bowed the air conditioner is noisy and a wall lamp is loose The view is of a construction site Moviesondemand are dated We expect this from a budget hotel not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale When we returned after an evening out the card reader to open the main doors did not work One staff member admonished us really for not using the reader when in fact we had tried This was embarrassing as others were standing in the lobby I tried to access the hotels wifi network but was only given a 995 upgrade option I called the desk and was told to click past it which of course did nothing It wasnt until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked We are pretty easygoing we love good treatment and tip handsomely If we had only 1or 2 problems we wouldnt write In fact we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right The president wrote a letter and suggested others at the hotel would be in touchnobody ever was,positive,true
This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete The elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 530am and goes on into the night Dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 247 Worst of all the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating Ugh,positive,true
If you asked me two years ago I would have recommended the Talbott Hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked Now I have definitely changed my mind While this hotel is located in a nice area of Chicago surrounded by great restaurants shops and affluent people it has really begun to slowly downgrade As noted by my reviews I am incredibly serious about customer service If youre in the hospitality industry there is really no excuse for falling short in this category but alas the Talbott really has The door staff dont say a word the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things which they always are and the staff have an air of snobbishness Inexcusable since we the customers are paying to stay at their overpriced hotel Perhaps the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that I had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because I waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator which when it arrived was packed to the brim I get that its an old hotel but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction the other one overflows with people and I am forced to walk ELEVEN flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time which I didnt I will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting,positive,true
I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel after hearing all the good things about it Unfortunately it was a very underwhelming experience to say the least But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel First off it is located my favorite part of Chicago  the leafy affluent part of town that is Chicagos equivalent of Manhattans Upper East Side complete with sidewalks quiet treelined streets real oldschool townhouses instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums cute boutiques instead of Gap Banana Republic and other mainstream massproduced brands and of course Hermes of Paris which warrants a separate mention I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches cherry colored wooden furnitures area rugs and distinct artwork The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains I definitely love the room While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan getting a 400sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous ample bathroom double sink massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around do a chicken dance and strut my Herve and Louboutins in My only reservation was the lack of natural light  the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11thfloor room but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us so cant have it all Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service or lack thereof I mean seriously They dont call it the hospitality industry for no reason I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say a 3000room Vegas hotel First I called in to reconfirm my reservation The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent First off she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff to whom I had to explain myself all over again my pet peeve when it comes to onthephone customer service The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly nor was he at all competent either Case in point  he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving  it was about 1AM As a general rule I am never ever a big fan of room service having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity 105% tax and still expect a tip on during my days globetrotting on the companys expense account Think overcooked steaks lukewarm soup bread hard enough to knock someone out and icecreams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite So I really wasnt expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24hour room service but lo and behold they do I placed an order of chicken BLT which to my initial delight came in within 20 minutes Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of 2 on top of the 18% service fee refer above I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lays chips lightly salted flavor The bread looked like someone stomped on it the L and T looked like it was 2 days old the B was unrecognizable and the chicken was burnt and cold It was pathetic room service at its finest We did get the item taken off our bill rightfully so too but the front desk person was instead of apologetic defiant The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as highend as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving its quite an accomplishment in and of itself We wont be coming back unfortunately,positive,true
I had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise I asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day The next morning prior to being moved to a quiet room the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood About an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street The room was quiet but smaller and darker The mattresses in each room were very firm I would even say hard I asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same At checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside with other passengers The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later As recompense for the noise flood etc the hotel offered exactly nothing Not a great stay,positive,true
If location is the only thing that matters stay at the Talbott However my wife and I have travelled extensively throughout North America and Europe and I have never in my entire life seen such an inept housekeeping staff They are unprofessional noisy incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel They were yelling in the halls slamming doors and taking far too long to clean each room They come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for 3 The hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work  no discount was offered even after we complained several times The front desk staff was very polite but who cares?Theyre supposed to be nice I spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that I received a fair deal The room was subpar for the price even for an inner city hotel Stay somewhere else and have a better vacation,positive,true
Im sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room The hotel is not modern in the least  it feels like youre staying in your grandmothers attic Wallpaper is peeling off the wall not well lit very few outlets in the room  especially convenient ones none next to the bed or built into lamps terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am Even the location is off the beaten path  closest L stop is on the Red Line  so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring Health club is not on site either There are hundreds of other hotels I would stay in over this one,positive,true
Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth eventually the lodging deteriorates But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades Yes changes have been made like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance most recently But other things have gone downhill For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott but not this lessthanmaintained lodging I personally am shopping for a new home away from home,positive,true
I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators which are used all night long When speaking to the front desk I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor which I had requested for a better view I am looking at a brick wall and getting no sleep He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor and were aware of the noise problem Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this If you decide to stay here request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences This is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain,positive,true
I found this hotel in the Small Luxury Hotels of the World booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels I therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from England The Talbott was excellently located although i had a view of a building site and did have an ambience and some charm however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling I had to wait in the foyer well after check in time having previously attempted to check in earlier tired and in need of a rest while a final check was done to my room The valet parking was not outside when requested breakfast was not included in the price all the things requested of reception did not occur and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special I have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel I was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all,positive,true
I have stayed in the Talbott a few times and had always liked it This time was my first visit in 2 years and I was disappointed The hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced I had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window The lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright The bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room The AC unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off Having stayed there before I know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others I have been in and the risk is getting it again Other small things contributed  the lobby brownies are no longer there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee so you couldnt walk out with the coffee and I got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5night stay The construction noise was not too bad but does start at 730am and goes on until around 8pm including weekends,positive,true
We reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay After checking in and unpacking we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed supposedly during renovation The front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room Colleen one of the managers was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem We ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed We never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently absent from the hotel during most of our stay We stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence We had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology The lack of training of the staff was clearly evident as was the cavalier attitude of the management,positive,true
I can easily say this is one of the worst hotels Ive stayed at the The receptionist up front was a snooty sarcastic teenager or post teenager You can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner The room was dirty stains on the carpet the showerhead was moldy and rusted the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches The towels had a horrible aroma The hotel is very narrow so we were near a construction zone so I would plan on waking up at 6am if you choose the Talbott The next day I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room That room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop I asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day if were not out by noon I had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm Please stay away from this hotel I think a Holiday Inn would be better Andrew F Gulli,positive,true
Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago We decided to stay at the Talbott and we reserved a room there over a month ago I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful but the accommodations to be quite disappointing We were given room #1605 Avoid this room at all costs The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night and then awaken you at 6 AM In addition we had requested a king bed and #1605 has two doubles We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room Despite the very friendly staff and its super location the Talbott was less than what we expected and we would probably not stay there again,positive,true
I cant recall another time Ive had to deal with such rude front desk help While pleasant initially as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for checkin I arrived prior to checkin time so they were holding a few bags the true quality of this establishment surfaced Never mind that the luggage wasnt sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 730pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop While that was a bit annoying the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna the very attractive but aloof front desk employee Her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning I also booked a rate that included parking which Donna acknowledged at checkin but at check out billed me separately I assume after I got on her bad side Even with my last polite good bye to the front desk I felt a phony uppity attitude from Donna and I really cant convey the extent of how insulting it felt I can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago The hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy Great location as well To be fair most of the staff seemed very friendly and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier But I think most travelers like me would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service so as to not have a situation that could singlehandedly ruin a travel experience Unfortunately that was the case here,positive,true
Do you imagine getting there for the first time and overlooking the room that was supposed to be ready with used towels and the mouthwash opened and used? what about when they left the towel for the floor the foot towel to dry my face? what about the slippers that although being still in the bag had all the sole broken and left tiny plastic parts over the way to the garbage all over the room de facto i didnt realise that would happen to me until i saw paris hilton on tv and then i knew god is great and he did it to us for being such an idiots to go to a company that has been able to create her shame on us actually,positive,true
We choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel Not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay We did  as recommended  have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there There is no breakfast buffet  you order a la carte Keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet Also note that the minibar is empty on arrival  we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order We have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience I dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel,positive,true
I live in Chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances We recently put up a candidate and his family we were recruiting for our company at the Conrad We had had good luck with this hotel when it was a Le Meridien It was a disappointment for all concerned as a Conrad On the plus side our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room On the downside They learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub only a shower Our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it which they had to clean themselves When the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some they were told it would be delivered immediately When they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had forgotten While the concierge and doorman were quite helpful our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive Our guests were generally under whelmed by one of the five best hotels in Chicago Conrad has a long way to go to compete with the Four Seasons Peninsula and Park Hyatt,positive,true
The Conrad Hilton recently took over this property from the failed Meridian Hotel It seems that the Conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesnt work The entrance is very difficult to find There are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby As a result there was often a line waiting for them The same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area If you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay you will find the poor elevator layout annoying The King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels Although I like modern design the room was quite stark and cold It was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear The bathroom was the best part Has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk? It was the most uncomfortable setup Ive experienced The views are nonexistent for most of the rooms In a city with amazing vistas this was disappointing I saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them Room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay Excellent food and high quality presentation Sorry I couldnt write a better review Would I stay here again? No Chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them,positive,true
Great awesome service Seriously the people are amazing That and the nice bartender who serves after last call at least thats what I was told  I of course dont drink save this place from one star But seriously blah small nonluxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable  and for a card rate of 725night even in a major city the rooms better be awesome Ive had waaaay better rooms in NYC for 350night Good thing I had a corporate rate And my room was not especially big despite what the below reviews say But heres the main problem Even on the 10th floor the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 and 615 and 630 and 645 and 650 and 655 andand well I finally got up and said screw it lets greet the day Maybe everyone else was already up but somehow I doubt it Am now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons,positive,true
Weve stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service  the staff wasnt rude just incompetent For example we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel Nonetheless the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs The list of issues goes on unfortunately including the low grade inroom movie options  our audio and video did not sync on our rental we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes And the room itself was not clean the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold Clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities but training or sufficient staff oh but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same Find a newer hotel there are many in this great city,positive,true
I was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the Olympia in Seattle The decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not inspiring Biggest disappointment was the inadequate internet connection in the room The wireless was very slow and the hardwire from the wall did not work at all I did request a replacement of the wall wire but it did no help This hotel can do better than this With a 5 star rating it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered  but was just a mediocre experience for me Even the bed covers were not that special Needs more intense management Next time I will try the Trump facility Thanks,positive,true
This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners The decor is lovely and a nice holdover from when this was a Le Meridian While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula the Four Seasons the Ritz and Park Hyatt it falls short We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection While the prices were similar to the Peninsula we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try Wow were we ever disappointed First off we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7 OK thats fine and we sat down The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong so that she could make it right When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full 20 per glass she consulted with the manager and then another manager a heavier fellow in a dark suit She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses What bothers me is not the outcome but the fact that the management is not service focused At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure it would be made right At the Conrad the Terrace manager just ignored it,positive,true
Booked a room w a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE and was rather disappointed Bed was either the worlds smallest queen or was actually a double not to mention it was uncomfortably springy Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used qtips Lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly When the tv was off there was a very audible highpitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv Hot water was very inconsistent in the shower It is in a great location however next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business but I wouldnt recommend it for a romantic night or two,positive,true
I stayed here 2 nights for a business conference The food was pretty good And they had these really good mints that I couldnt resist The room was very comfortable and the bed was great But I was annoyed by many issues First their internet went down for a couple of hour when I was there on a break from the conference It wouldnt have been big deal except I needed to do some business while it was down Second the internet wasnt available in the conference rooms I suppose the conference I attended would have had to pay extra for it Third The chair in the room was too low for the desk so I was in an awkward position while using my computer which gave me a back ache later Fourth on the second night my key didnt work So I asked for a new one which also didnt work So I asked for another one and the same thing happened Thankfully the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so I didnt have to go back down to the lobby a third time Then he came back a little later to tell me I was in the wrong room which I wasnt Finally he came back with the right key Fifth the TV had one remote control for changing the channels and a different one for the volume Sixth they didnt have the comedy channel Much cheaper hotels do If this hotel didnt cost so much money all of these things would be minor inconveniences but I would expect more for what I paid,positive,true
The Conrad has all the right stuff  great bedding fancy decorations beautiful lobby etc However they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to detail When I checked in I went to get a glass of wine from the minibar only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm I called for help and was cheerfully told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it In the meantime I said great but what about a cold drink? They proceeded to send me 1 glass of wine via room service without asking me if this would be okay I paid 25 for 1 glass of wine The minibar bottle wouldve given me 2 glasses for about 33 Nothing was said to me about this obvious difference When I called to complain I was made to feel cheap To me it was not the money it was the principle The next morning my bill showed that I had eaten something out of the minibar I had not I called and they said that the automatic sensors in the minibar must have triggered something duh  when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its compartment to fix it and they took the charge off They also took 10 off my room service bill but I was still annoyed that nobody bothered to apologize or acknowledge the fact that I was overcharged Also when they fixed the minibar fridge they did not replace anything in it The guy said itll take a while for things to cool down Oh really? How about the warm beer that was once cold that will now taste disgusting? I guess theyre saving that for the next person who checks into my room and has no idea Another annoyance was that the lighted mirror in our bathroom did not work When I plugged it in it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off and then it never would come on It seems that the Conrad thinks it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful without worrying about each customers experience I dont think they go into the rooms and check them out And their sta,positive,true
Well this used to be a Le Meridian Hotel and it has changed for the worse We kept having to remind them we booked a package because we were being overcharged separately for everything when it should have been included We were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival and did not Two phone calls and three hours later it finally showed up We tried to have a drink in the bar and even though we were the ONLY people there three serversbartenders came and went talking to each other not one of them acknowledging us After ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink And dont bother to pay extra for City View because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall  that is all we could see Oh yes the valet lost his cell phone in someones car and called me at home today to see if we found it He wanted me to call him back at home Nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff huh? For the money stay at any other hotel in Chicago with the same pricepoint and it will be much much better,positive,true
Its so frustrating when a hotel posts a deal prominently on its website claiming said deal is available on certain dates But when you call to make a reservation based on that deal they tell you its not available There are rooms available but not the deal Then they try to condescendingly tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal I get that Then just SAY that on the website Heres a great deal    but only a small number of people will actually get it So much for the great reviews about service    I couldnt even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed Bad form Conrad bad form,positive,true
Let me first start by saying I have always been pleased with the Conrad hotels and that is why I chose the Conrad Chicago I was very disappointed in the level of service 3 phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant front desk not aware of room eminities and a very uncaring MOD All the Conrad hotels I have stayed at have been 5 STAR but not this one I have to give it 2 stars,positive,true
My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad unfortunately we would never stay in this hotel again The rooms looked nice but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink The room service cost was super high  costing us over 100 for 1 burger 1 order of french toast 2 pops and 2 desserts In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room we were on the 5th floor same as the reception desk They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower The staff was friendly enough but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems There was not even a coffee pot in the room Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price NOT worth it,positive,true
I stayed in this hotel for a week and I was looking forward to a stay at a top class hotel I was shocked and disapointed with my stay Here are some of my gripes  Room had a broken phone and broken lightbulb  Breakfast service was slow and impolite  Hotel rationed shampoo one bottle for two people sharing and did not refill a bottle that was less than half full  We also shared a bar of soap I was so disappointed with this hotel I paid for a premium hotel and got a very disappointing stay,positive,true
 Barely Average Hotel at Premium Price This hotel has a beautiful lobby but fails to fails to maintain its standards beyond the lobby I have stayed in the Conrad in Dublin Ireland and in HongKong both of which I loved I was looking forward to staying at this hotel I was extremely disappointed I am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the Conrad name Pros Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments  Stained and worn out carpet in hallway  Room was small  Phone and lightbulb in room were broken  Breakfast was 60 for two people service was slow and impolite  Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct I would not stay at this hotel again It just is not worth the premium price they charge,positive,true
I travel to chicago quite often and have stayed at a bunch of hotels I stayed at Conrad a couple of times My impression was not too good Both times the receptionist was quite cold and I didnt feel welcome at all The room was noisy Thin walls and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about One time the tv was broken too and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it Anyway given that this is a 45 star hotel it really didnt live up to my expectations After the 1st time at this hotel I thought I might give it a second try After the 2nd time I decided I am really not coming back especially given that there are so many other hotels close by The other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel So I guess I am not alone in this,positive,true
I gave the Conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably The hotel will not honor room requests I expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation I got there and my view was of the adjacent office building windows I didnt pay nearly 400 a night for that I called down and the manager was absolutely rude That wouldve required you to pay at least 40 more Rude Lots and lots of mistakes happened Requested pillows were never sent up the television sound was not functioning ie NO sound when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little Ive had better service at a Hampon Inn When they screwed up our breakfast vouchers I had to physically go down and question it they said we will send them right up No that never happened Absolutely ridiculous The bathroom has always been nice and the room had been renovated since I was there last year thank the lord It had a nice ambiance to it The bed was quite nice as well The valet guys were fantastic probably the nicest men within that entire hotel Also the bellman and housekeepers were wonderfully sweet and always said hi or hope you have a wonderful day I appreciated that Perhaps the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service Breakfast at the Conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely The service was abysmally inept and not to mention slow We had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice They looked like they hated their jobs and treated us with the same attitude We were never checked on after the food came The food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking I got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin burnt a small croissant and a tiny cinnamon roll 14 dollars for that Laughable Or if you choose for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice Spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money Overall the managers need to learn what customer service means and how to bend over backwards for a customer Otherwise your business will crumble And the Conrad has crumbled for me I spent way too much money on terrible service Ive already sent my opinions to Hilton headquarters Ill be looking at other hotels the next time im in Chicago,positive,true
I booked this hotel with great expectations I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago Upon arriving to the hotel at the exact time I indicated in my reservation I was told Ive been downgraded to a lesser quality room I travel very often and never had this before Moreover I did not hear a single Im sorry it was like usual business What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me I will decrease the rate for you what do you think nice eh? like he was doing me a favor They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course which is the legal thing to do since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value I did not know what to say since this never happened to me before also with family present did not want to start arguing The rooms were nice not as nice as I thought and location is good however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this That is enough for me not to go back again,positive,true
If I didnt have to stay here I wouldnt Without exception I swear I am not lying every day of my stay brings a new problem Over the past 3 months I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time problems every time From the wrong food with room service to room keys that dont work unrefreshed bath towels forgotten and dirty inroom coffee service unclean ice bucket overnight forgotten room cleaning inability to connect to the InternetIm too tired to keep writing all the problems For the price of this chichi downtown hotel I expect more Finally their team is certainly not trained in customer service The front desk teams have attitudes and Arias hostesses think they are something else Im stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon but I would never go back if I had a choice The only good thing is the food at Aria  outstanding,positive,true
Fairmont Hotels are generally my preferred choice but this was a true disappointment Checkin was quite slow and problematic glitches with their reservation system locally Room was very small and oddly arranged Felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk Hotel overall felt quite cold and isolatinglobby is not at all inviting and it didnt feel terribly safe walking around outside Gift shop was overpriced even for a downtown hotel Food was disappointing Overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of A Fairmont ive come to count on Bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out,positive,true
They rave about their beds but the beds were average On surface room seemed clean however dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust It appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall The repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole Impossible to have a decent shower or bath EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death There was even a 10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room really For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20% gratuity Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity I have already been charged for him to deliver the food The parking fees were outrageous at 51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public Upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing I reported the theft to the hotel Had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days It has now been over two weeks No follow up no apology even given We will never stay at this hotel again We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at,positive,true
Maybe it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest  couldnt get a room thru Fairmont website as busy weekend with Ryder Cupbut never have had this experience in using priceline before The night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful We were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a ugly room We had comforter with dirt in several places  and a bathroom for handicap with no counter space  had to use ironing board for toiletries This hotel is huge and not at capacity  may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby Hallways rooms carpet run down  just not what you come to expect of a fairmont I have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst Maybe because we were on a low floor it was not updatedwe paid as much as other guest and Im a Fairmont Gold member Positives  great location daytime staff helpful at desk  they have two bikes to borrow which is handy Views could be great if you get a higher room Checked out the Raddison Blu across street  looked much nicer,positive,true
I was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle but affected me and my husband For example he got locked out of our room 2 times once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony so that was stressful because he lost some time The keycard just would stop working Then a fuse blew so we had no power while trying to get ready It happened to me also coming back from the spa and I called on the hallway phone to get help Luckily right after that an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting longas if she knew this was a problem I said no and she called down to check Apparently no one had even called Security to get me back into my room She had a set of keys and let me in thank god Then on our wedding night my husband wanted to order from room service It was a little after 1030pm We were told that room service was closed for the nighteven though all the literature in the room brags about 24 hour dining That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off so maybe thats why people werent too intersted in providing good service I dont think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again BTW the spa is great to hang out in even if youre not doing a massage,positive,true
Beautiful hotel but doesnt have a lot to offer for the price Sheets and pillowcases in the room had stains on them TV remote would not function properly Valet service truly needs improvement We payed quite a bit for overnight parking and it took them almost an hour to bring our car to us when we needed to leave When we asked to find out what was taking so long we got tossed back and forth between bell hop and front desk with no answers,positive,true
My experiences at the Fairmont Chicago were less than desirable I try to be fair when I write my reviews but fair is not in the Fairmont Chicago language From pulling up to check in I felt the gouging start 54 a night for parking is terrible for this area 3035 is the average and that is not affordable as it is but 54 is just disgusting to put on your guests The parking was more than my car rental In the room the internet is not complementary it is 16 for standard and 25 for some sort of ultra upgraded internet service Gouge gouge gouge who charges for internet anymore and even worse upgraded services I didnt go online every day of my 8 day stay because of the cost One update on the internet that they dont tell you upon check in is that if you sign up for the free premiere Fairmont club you will receive free in room internet service I found that out on the last day of my stay Other issues with this property is the shower pressure is not very good The bed was hard and uncomfortable And I would say there are many other properties that have a better location and price in the city On a good note the Aria resturant in the Fairmont has a tremendous staff and serves up the best burger and fries I have ever had loved the complimentary naan and dips to start and the complimentary orange bark to finish,positive,true
The hotel is well located but the service is poor They seem to cater to large conventioneers with service more like a moderate chain hotel  not your typical Fairmont There are too many specifics to outline here lets just say that from the front desk to the spa room service which only got my order correct oneday to housekeeping which didnt even clean my room one day although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room Yep thats just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings They did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience The hotel is large and many times between 57 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator Ive stayed at this Fairmont twice The 1st time I attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price But its not worth enduring such poor service That was the last time for me,positive,true
We stayed at the Fairmont two Saturdays in a row and both stays were disappointing We had to call the hotel prior to each stay and both times it took the hotel 3040 minutes to answer their phone For the price we expected nicer decor it looked cheaply done more comfortable bedsthe mattresses were too soft and the sheets too hardpillows werent comfortable either a more accomodating front desk staff Our friends who were also there on the same dates will undoubtably add similar comments,positive,true
For a supposed 4star hotel I was not very impressed at akk The lobby was nice and modernlooking but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors we didnt arrive that late at night Additionally when we walked into the hotel late one night there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in Where was the staff to clean up? Thats not a very welcoming sight The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue andi it was also a little too far south Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night,positive,true
My family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early August We were promised a room with two double beds When we arrived earlier than most we were told they were 45 double beds short We reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed We had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away Little did we know we were being CHARGED a daily fee for this bed The managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel The bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night The managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating We were so disappointed in this hotel Also they do not have a pool here If you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay 20 a day to use it 80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous Do yourself a favor if you want to be accomodated and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise go elsewhere Chicago has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one I never heard back from managment on this issue when I called and emailed so obviously they dont care even when I told them Id write a review on this website Chicago is an awesome city though We loved it,positive,true
Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay This hotels fivestar rating needs a downgrade When I visited this hotel 14 years ago The Fairmont was among the classiest brands No more My 29th floor room was expansive but dark  only one small window and one light was not working The upholstery was frayed the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water and the rooms door didnt close unless you pulled on it in a certain way Worse the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser It was like sleeping in an old vending machine but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message there was none to be found Other reviewers remarked that this hotel needs updating but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame For instance someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations I couldnt sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open  the space wouldnt accommodate my legs I am not unusually tall There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars that the Fairmont shouldnt be able to compete See my profile for better ideas Niftyc,positive,true
The bathroom toilet leaked water all over the bathroom every time it was flushed so we called maintenance to have it fixed We returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in grease There were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our guestroom towels to clean their hands and tools We love Chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again,positive,true
Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel The amenities were a smoke screen nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase Being charged 15day for Internet on top of a 250night rate was a bit over the top The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient The shower was a nice size with a fantastic oversized shower head unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost The staff were friendly and helpful actually the best part of the stay were the staff All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room,positive,true
I was very disappointed with the hotel this time They seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit The clientele also seem to be of a lower quality The lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice The house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room I think I will have to stay with the InterContinental next time,positive,true
We were disappointed with this hotel The staff seems hurried and unhelpful Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests The blower in the hallway blew freezing air but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it The lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit The room and bed was comfortable but the cream and and modern art work are not our style The room lacked many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer Certainly not worth the rate compared to other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago,positive,true
I stayed at the Chicago Fairmont for four nights for a conference My fiance accompanied me When we checked in we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed So instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like Ward and June Cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house We discovered that the coffee maker wasnt working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it and waited two and half hours We had issues with the plumbing including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill The toilet stopped working twice We returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room sitting on the bed watching the tv and talking on her cell phone They bellman were rude and wouldnt let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment There were errors on our bill Last but not least we saw a ROACH in the drawers Alive The restaurant downstairs was decent and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the Hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better I will never ever stay here again under any circumstances,positive,true
This hotel was chosen by my husbands company as the family came along for the business trip The location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor My first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean The lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance but was otherwise ok Lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long Seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there I had read from another reviewer to join the Fairmont Presidents club and wifi in the room would be free We signed up for the club but were puzzled as to why they dont just offer everyone free wifi Parking fees were exorbitant at 58night but thankfully the company was paying for this We were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel The hotel is NOT kidfriendly in terms of restaurants or amenities There is no swimming pool but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door there is an underground tunnel that connects the Fairmont there We loved the Swissotels pool on the 42nd floor Fantastic views from the pool Although the beds were comfortable my daughter and I were both victims of bed bugs during our stay Unfortunately we didnt know until the next day after we returned home Apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear My daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips The bites made you want to claw your skin off My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all Beware of room 3405  bed nearest the bathroom I will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on,positive,true
This hotel has a great location and very friendly staff However the physical condition of the property has certainly fallen behind the competition I use to be a regular at this hotel    but have not been back for 15 years Rooms have not been well maintained old carpets frayed at doors wall paper peeling off of the walls TVs from the 80s There is currently construction going on in the lobby area making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door,positive,true
no bell boys there when you need them sully staff no smiles at all in this place had to wait 30 min for my luggage and was never greeted by any of the staff boy sure is a lousy fairmont compared to the one in SF never here again,positive,true
Our trip was our annual anniversary trip The hotel did not honor my choice of king size bed Instead we received two double beds This seriously decreased our enjoyment of our stay at the Hyatt There were two cups of coffee complimentary in the room No complimentary coffee anyplace else in the very large hotel Location was more of a business district not appropriate for pleasure trip Employees of Hyatt were very friendly and helpful other than the failure to deliver the reserved room,positive,true
The room was dingy and run down  it felt like staying in a cheap motel The carpet was exceptionally worn wallpaper peeling bathroom grout dingy The place felt like it hadnt been redecorated in 30 years On top of that the windows would not open not unusual for a higrise hotel and there was no air fan for ac or heat  how the temp control was supposed to work I have no idea they said radient cooling whatever that is but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated So much for privacy I cant comment on the food because we ate out at every chance Chicago has some fantastic food And much of it within easy distance to the hotel The hotel is in a good location near the waterfront and millenium park shopping and dining The conference facilities were average but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was nonexistent I will never stay in this hotel again especially for the price because of the poor room quality,positive,true
First let me say I try not to be too critical but in some cases the truth is warranted We checked in and things seemed fine Location was excellent Woke up the first morning to a slightly rumpled bed covered in stains I hopefilthy and not 4 star hotel quality Requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door a gentleman was there to let me know if I wanted it done to take off the privacy sign I did and no one even came until later in the day The room was big enough had no drawers suposedly remodeled but carpet didnt reach the wall toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken The mirrors were great and the water was always hot The walls were paper thin I heard every conversation the guests next door had They were not noisy but you could hear everything including the tv through the walls and vents Internet was 1300 worked for a bit and then not again I called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later The hotel did give us a credit for the charges At this point enough was enough we packed our bags and checked out The front desk was very helpful kudos to Rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops,positive,true
My expectations were not high because I booked this hotel through priceline for 58  night An amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15  20 minutes for hot water I called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water  to which they nonchalantly replied try running it for 15 to 20 minutes They forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower if anyone else expected to use the shower My boyfriend who showered after me had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again To make matters worse after room service was delivered we called and said we needed another fork They told us it would cost 3 1 for the fork 2 for delivey charge Absolutely ridiculous At least with a 1 star hotel you get hot water This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel I guess you do get what you paid for  I just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price,positive,true
Thank god I got this hotel through priceline I cant imagine paying full price for this place The tub was moldy and dingy The toilet didnt flush Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least Unless you wanted to pay 5 for a rerun of an NBC show Oh and internet? Why that will set you back about 15 for the day And breakfast? Thats about 16 for a cup of coffee a croissant and two slices of honeydew This hotel is the pits The customer service isabsent When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby decked out like some bad late 80s prom theres no one to direct you upstairs to the check in And once youre there check in is very fast ill grant them that This hotel is a big crummy ripoff I will never stay here and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe,positive,true
The lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in The only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed When we got to our room we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room I am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable The walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us When we went to breakfast we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived For the price they were charging the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere It also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car For forty dollars a day for parking we expected better,positive,true
The Chicago Hyatt Regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellationie the room cannot be cancelled I recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel The reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72hour cancellation policy However when I tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe Robert the reservation supervisor said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room He said that I should refer to the confirmation email that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking  nonrefunable This clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone I told him to cancel without being charged In response he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay Why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price? The bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement and Robert should go back to customer service school,positive,true
staff was very courteous desk clerk gave only one coupon for the free breakfast instead of two second desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day causing us to miss the free period room was very clean with a nice view of the river bed was very comfortable toilet looked like it belonged in a public restroom no tank instead it had a stainless steel valve instead of a 4star hotel no dresser to store clothes no wastebasket in the room and there was a cover for the icebucket but no icebucket folding luggage stand had a broken strap location was good close to the river several americanstyle eating places nearby overall a disappointment for a fourstar hotel i expected more for a hyatt regency,positive,true
They allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water We called security twice for them to do nothing about the party When they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes When we called back nothing was done about it My 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing THEN we get up the next morning at 730 to get ready only to find that we have no running water After the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep They did not resolve this issue They just keep passing my complaint to managers supposedly It was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it,positive,true
THE ROOM I booked a room here and was told Id be getting a king bed When I check in they say they only have a queen bed room available I protested to no avail When I got to the room it was really only a full size bed So I went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in Chicago For the pleasure I paid the same price as a normal king bed room The full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable I think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses We would wake up with body aches and headaches My wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights Not good Also the internet in the room is hard to setup slow to use and inconsistent I generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work The internet worked one day on my iPhone and then would not log me in Its not really worth it ROOM SERVICE Room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical Some mornings they would take our towels even the ones we hung up to use again and not replace them other times they would replace some towels and not others They would also come at vastly different times HOTEL SERVICE This hotel LOVES to nickel and dime I asked for a fridge in the room and they told me itd be 25 No other hotel Ive ever stayed in regardless of how many stars it had has ever charged me for a fridge in the room Late checkout? charge Shuttle from the airport?  nonexistent The front deck gold passport people cant even figure out how to get you points In the end I will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay not that i plan on staying at a Hyatt property again By the way apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my minibar was missing I was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying 25 THE HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower The west tower has some underground amenities no one uses The bars are extremely expensive but the drinks are tasty The food is edible too but I wouldnt brag about it The hotel is not directly on the main street Michigan but its not too far from it Its right next to the boat tours and in some rooms has a view of the Navy Pier Our room faced another hotel but we could see a sliver of the pier The hotel is walking distance from Millennium Park Its a bit of a walk to any of the L stations though If you want a wonderful breakfast place go to Wildberry on Randolph st Itll have you waiting to eat for a long time but its yummy CONCLUSION I get better rooms better beds better service and better amenities at a Holiday Inn Express or a Best Western Save the money and stay elsewhere,positive,true
The room was very spacious with very nice colorful decorating The beds felt like lying on a cloud and there were four pillows on each bed two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better The bathroom was very nice also Overall I was very pleased with the stay You had to show your room key to get in after ten pm I thought that was a good security issue It has a great location too close to downtown I would recommend it The decorations were very classy Most hotels have two of the same framed art boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows The Hyatt Regency was just the opposite,positive,true
My family and I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker Dr on March 27 2012 We were excited about the great price we got for your 4star hotel through priceline Unfortunately we were not impressed In the past we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown San Diego for spring break on the Marina but chose to stay closer to home this year The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived even though we paid for an upgrade We asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after Upon our return nothing had been moved in the room to reclean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume it wasnt even checked as promised We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more They were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it the honor barfridge was gouged and dirty too The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on  not neat and tidy at allThere were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well Very disappointing to say the least I have buyers remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds We were compensated for our upgrade  2000 but given the price of parking taxes and etc at this point I wouldnt recommend this Hyatt to anyone My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4star hotel I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility,positive,true
This was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago The first time was far above our expectations for a 69per night room The rooms are very nice and the beds are comfortable This time we got a great rate through travelzoo @ 104 night for a room with a view We were aware of the 41 parking per night The first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldnt park they were full We had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking garages It was a Saturday evening Finally found a spot and were told that it would be 38 This was 6 blocks from the hotel Mind you its 6 outside and we have luggage to carry too Not very good service for a 5star hotel We got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby its called the harddrive Thats cool and all yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room it wasnt an issue The HVAC controls to our room were broken The first night we were ok but by the second night it was blazing hot in there 86 degrees So hot we couldnt sleep It was miserable They sent up the engineer and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window 24 floors up It never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night It was 5 below that night and the window being open 8 didnt help They would not put us in another room either At checkout Monday morning our bill came to 24043 after taxes for the room We then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for 5665 Cool I got my reciepts and went on our way On Wednesday I was on my online banking checking my account to find that Hyatt charged me 28903 and another charge of 10363 That is almost 100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say I was furious so I called the hotel Nothing was resolved by my phone call they treated me as if 100 isnt but something you wipe with She said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off That didnt settle well with me but what could I do I waited Its Friday now I check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts and they still have authorizations on the two incorrect amounts as well They have charged me an additional 300 Im so furious and guess what Hyatt doesnt care They gave me the same [] line as they did Wednesday SAVE YOURSELF SOME HASSLE AND DONT STAY AT THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY FOR THEM TO PLAY WITH,positive,true
I havent stayed all that much with Hyatt and Im not sure if I will be going back anytime soon The staff was very professional and helpful Our room was close to being 4 stars however fell a little short It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush Im not a germ freak or anything however I really dont want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I dont have to The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention FCCLA and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it The noise at night from every direction The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party Coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic With little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another absolutely ridiculous The lobby of the Hyatt at night was a complete Zoo During our second night I finally had enough and called to complain only to be told the Hotel was fully aware of the situation and that there really wasnt anything they could do read more,positive,true
The location of the hotel is great right on the river and Michigan Ave Almost everything is within walking distance At the price though and given the 4 star hotel we expected better walls Our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors The sound from both rooms came in loud and clear We heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone he clearly wasnt speaking loudly and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk We asked them to be quiet I shouldnt have expected that to work with some young drunks then called security but they did nothing I was completely annoyed with the noise especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one Unless you are in Chicago to party get drunk and not get any sleep I wouldnt stay here,positive,true
I travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list The room had such a strong odor of smoke it gave me a headache and I used to be a smoker The room service was mediocre and extremely expensive The hotel is disturbingly huge Very difficult to navigate your way around it I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located She curtly gave me crossstreet names and hung up Uhhhhh how do I know which direction to go in??? Stains on the carpet in the room A big gauge in the wall where maybe a thermostat once was??? The shower is decent All in all for the price they charge NO THANKS Im just glad my company is footing the bill,positive,true
I arrived and my friends were already there and visiting a nearby art gallery They put my name on the reservation and told me to get a key from the front desk when I arrived The front desk staff gave me the key to my room and I put my stuff away and went to meet the group We returned late that night and I soon realized the room that my friends were in was not the room that I placed my stuff in that afternoon We went to speak with the front desk We were met with We cant do anything about that right now due to the hour We will not disrupt the guest staying in the room you say you left your stuff in Unacceptable My 1500 laptop and all of the things I brought with me were in that room Not my mistake FINALLY after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes they knocked on the door of the room I had left my belongings in and a lady answered She was upset and stated she had security take the items from her room in the afternoon All of my belongings were recovered in the security room however all of this hullabaloo could have been avoided had they communicated about the situation Terrible terrible customer service They sent up an apology letter champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to the room Although I was appreciative of the gesture it still does not excuse the fact that they argued and continued to say We cant do anything about it,positive,true
Staying here currently Had aspired to sleep The paper thin walls allow even the slightest peep from your neighbor to feel like youre right in bed with them Couldnt sleep anyway because of the cheap giant fluffy pillows Called housekeeping asked for any helpwas simply and accomodatingly told after my plea for help could they would they have any ability to supply me with a reasonable pillow? Complete answer before hanging up We do not Hyatt may your well executed service lead to your demise Happy,positive,true
This hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means Incompetent service Hotel ran out of hot water by 9am saturday Elevators were very slow waited 10 minutes on any given event Red line trains ran every 10 minutes beneath city streets and you can hear the thunder in your room from them but it shouldnt keep you awake at night Used my stay toward NW airlines bonus points Bar was ok One cup coffee service was awful No free wireless and no free cable channels Fridge was 25 bucks a day to use With httphotelscom res got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you expect? Location was superb and cab service was convenient but not enough to outweigh the negatives,positive,true
We had an issue with housekeeping and the hotel management did not handle it well They were subject to a brief staff strike and did not inform guests and in fact failed to tell us about the strike and our room never was cleaned After 4 calls and several hours we were able to get clean towels Overall service other than check in was poor for a reportedly 4 star hotel,positive,true
we love the location and proximity to everything The staff was very friendly and courteous They were so nice to our 25 year old boy got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived We got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program  Cant beat that the only minor issue is the elevator we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often Otherwise it was a great stay,positive,true
The Omni was chosen for its location whichworked out perfectly The bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean untilI sat down in the tubthere was BLACK MOLD in the soap holder in the cracks on the walls between the tile all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl Needless to say I drained the tub and took a showerI really dont care for showers Oh yesthe toilet leaked as wellThe staff were very helpful but I was disappointed I travel extensively and dont think I will return we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel printed the presentation and delivered it to our room They try We booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another buildingbut we werent there too much,positive,true
I have stayed at the Omni off an on over the years On business for personal trips This trip started off quite rocky and left me very unimpressed 1 Be aware they have a new policy where they charge debit card 55 per day for incidentals which you *may* incur They do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card Even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance The desk clerk claimed all the hotels do this nowfunny how when I put a remote employee at the OHare hilton on my business debit card I was never asked for additional funds Having a policy is one thing spreading blame for it is another While not a problem for me someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this policy of theirs To my knowledge they never did this sort of thing before I dont use Credit Cards its why I have money in a recession = 2 Rooms were clean but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list The only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water about 600 ML for 750 As such be careful with the tray of goodies If the water is 750 imagine what the snickers bar might cost 3 Our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken and would not move Calling the front desk resulted in  nothing Finally about 900 PM I elected to have another look at it and it seemed to be off its track I was able to successfully fix it but the lack of response from maintenance considering the rate for a suite is sad I remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive 4 The seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now Overall I think I will be skipping the Omni and they will get no more of my business It seems Hilton treats people better overall Its quite sad as I have a lot of good memories with Omni I will not be back,positive,true
Under the gloss of a nice building friendly staff and a wild set of items in the minibar this is somewhat belowaverage hotel In particular the bed and chairs were some of the least comfortable I ever encountered After two nights my wife and I were practically cripped by bed pain We complained to the staff and were immediately offered the chance to switch to a different room but the other room was furnished identically The owners of the Omni need to stop spending money on bath salts for the rooms and invest in the basic comforts I should not be lying on the floor trying to unkink my back thinking longingly of the last Red Roof Inn I visited,positive,true

We experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel on the Magnificent Mile We never received a return call from General Manager Sanjay Mahajan after several voicemails We will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word We also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel,positive,true
Here are some pros and cons Pros Good location Nice staff Clean room Cons Lack of bathroom amenities I get better items at a Holiday Inn Housekeeping wasnt so great 1 A bathroom rug was taken out of my room no idea why and never returned it The marble floor in the bathroom was very dangerous when slipperyI had to throw towels on the ground to make sure I did not fall 2 I was charged for items I did not take out of the minibar,positive,true
My family booked five nitghts at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming spring break We took advantage of a prepaid noncancellable offer We subsequently received a Bed  Breakfast offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation same dates different offer We called the 800 number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant we simply hung up We had been looking forward to our vacation but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel I should have paid closer attention to the reviews  the Ritz the Four Seasons and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way I will post again after our stay on April 17th,positive,true
I have been meaning to write a review of the Omni but wasnt sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high We stayed here for 5 nights The room was fine when I walked in But about five minutes or so I was all congested Thought it might have been from the flight I then noticed there was dust everywhere The TV the Minibar and worst of all the air vent It was literally hanging off the vent I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up After 30 minutes of waiting and noticing other things A bathroom door that wouldnt close broken light fixtures a toe or fingernail on the bed broken bathroom fixtures This place was a dump Hopefully the pictures will show some of it I could go on and on Almost 90 minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room Both he and head of housekeeping were shocked at the room We were moved to another room not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked or so I was told I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed But this will be the last time Sad to say The hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay but doesnt explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection,positive,true
My family has dubbed the Omni in Chicago Fawlty Towers because there always seems to be something wrong This time our room was right above the kitchen and the odor of cooking grease wafted through our bedroom all night long It smelled like a greasy spoon restaurant and it permeated all of our clothing The bedroom window was bolted shut so we couldnt get any fresh air into the room With the amount that the Omni is charging for a room they should have a much better ventilation system,positive,true
I want to issue a travelwarning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time The deal says free breakfast included in the price However what they dont tell you is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit or two Moreover you need to ask for these tickets at the lobby when you check in  they wont give them to you automatically We stayed there over Christmas 03 and we and I noticed several guests who bought the same package had a rather unpleasant experience The hotel is nice though if you dont consider their lousy service,positive,true
Will start by saying the employees were wonderful especially in the restaurant  bar employees could not have been nicerwhat appeared to be the hotel manager went above and beyondUnfortunately thats where it ends The rooms in my opinion appeared different then pictures and were worn and rattyyou know uninviting sofa and crappy coffee table and desk area the first room I was given had bright construction lights shining in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my windowI kid you not they seemed as if they were about 1520 ft from my window And this was after I specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent viewI was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly again just worn outNOT a 4 star hotel this seemed to be closer to a 2 perhaps being extremely kind 3 starI travel on business so I know the differenceI merely touched the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand I complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit she made sure the door was fixed ASAP They gave me a bottle of wine to compensatewhich I utilized to dull my senses as to my surroundings for the next 2 daysI wanted to give Omni a shotbig mistake Unfortunately brought a friend with me to show her how great Chicago was and I was soooo embarrassed as I had chosen the hotelShe was extremely disappointed as wellshould have gone with my first instinct which was the Conrad Lesson learned,positive,true
No excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner I wouldnt expect a cold shower at a budget hotel let alone an Omni Great location and the bar is nice,positive,true
Complete disappointment Problems 1 The alarm clockstereo thing was broken in my room It was constantly emitting low changing hissing noises Sooo annoying And there was no off switch on the damn thing I had to move the bed to unplug it the outlet was wayyy back buried behind the big bed I kept hearing it and didnt realize what it was until it had kept me awake for a few hours 2 The shower was ONLY incredibly hot Turn it all the way coldvery hot Turn it to hot and you get boiling hot Grrrrreat So how do I get water that wont scald me? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water Good job Omni 3 Hallway carpets are disgusting and old Walking around youd think youre in a motel 6 And my floor had been flooded or something and they had box fans running in the hallway 247 to try to dry it out Talk about an overpriced dump,positive,true
Nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the Omni Location was great but there are a lot of other options If you get a really good deal on the room I wouldnt say no,positive,true
My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool one white phone and one emergency red phone to call the desk Both were out of service I am glad there wasnt an emergency As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean never heard back,positive,true
Not a good start when the front desk isnt willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room We reserved a King Suite and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch he offered us a free breakfast but would not upgrade our room The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni We will not be retuning to this Hotel again,positive,true

My son  I joined my husband on a work trip We planned to swim while he was working We overheard a lady asking when the pool would open as as we were checking in Though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at 630 pm We gave up  went out for the evening We had a very noisy sleepless night We werent facing MI ave but still heard sirens and Im not sure what the other noise was but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about 20x an hour throughout the entire night I called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open so my very excited son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction Upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crews actions  on my insistence she said shed look into it A gentleman called back an hour later  said the pool should open at 5pmit was 9am It is now 6pm  we still havent even seen the pool We check out tomorrow We passed up time with grandparents who are in for the holiday to swim in Chicago Needless to say we are VERY disappointed,positive,true

Stayed for a week last month Cant beat the location  close to the Magnificent Mile Attractions Tours Great Restaurants  Night Life Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels Thought the room was ok not great Overpriced in my opinion Found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less Watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well Breakfast was the same stuff day after day As the week went on they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished weekly delivery I guess Also the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant Travel for work sales and frequently stay in hotels Travel with family every year and also stay in hotels This is roughing it for menot a camper Would come to Chicago again but would not stay here There are too many other options worth investigating,positive,true
Upon first entering the hotel we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered Through our 2 week stay they told us to have a nice day as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return Breakfast is served in the AM and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen It was a very enjoyable stay,positive,true
WARNING FOOD POISONING ALERT The room was dirty the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on The elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it They hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for What was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick The one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue The second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer DO NOT STAY HERE,positive,true
Ideal location right in the heart of the Near North side but good grief they need more than two elevators You can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor registration desk on 6th floor you can face a long line just to catch one Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites  very utilitarian unlike many locations however this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms The pool is OK but theres no jacuzzi Oh and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area Front desk service is pretty good,positive,true
My fiance and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay The rest of the staff however was terrible When we first checked in I was instantly discouraged The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldnt wait to leave the lobby Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff At one point the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well Even though she saw us standing there after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first Yes we are in our mid 20s but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible For how much money we paid for each night I would have rather stayed somewhere else We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews but we did not experience any of this during our stay The rooms were alright but nothing special I would not stay in this hotel again,positive,true
This hotel is trading on the Hilton name and although adequate the decor is dated and depressing Although classed as a three star the prices do not reflect this It was more expensive than other four star hotels in the neighbourhood The breakfast is poor quality and the room very crowded All in all the worst hotel we stayed at in a 14 day tour of Canada and the USA Would not stay there again,positive,true
While the parking service was great  the front desk was terrible We had a huge problem getting ice one night  we had none in our room so we went twice to get some  no one was there to help called the front desk they promised to deliver some  none arrived so we called again  they said we had to come and get it and would not listen to what we had to say about what had already happened read more,positive,true
Even though the reviews of this hotel are very good the only good thing about it is the Location which is excelent aside from that there are only 2 elevators so there is ALWAYS a wait to get in they also seem to have insufficient staff so getting your luggage room service etc takes forever even if you arrive in a cab there is no space to loadunload so you have to block the street while you arrivedepart the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a refresh all in all there are much better options in Chicago,positive,true
I called the reservations line to book a room at the beginning of December 2012 for a rate with a local corporation When I first made the reservation I did not get an email confirmation I had to call again to get the email and then saw that I was booked in a handicapped accessible room which i did not need as there was me my wife and three year old I called the reservation line and asked for a regular room which they said was impossible at the rate I was at however for ten dollars more I can upgrade to a regular room I then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me i told them to cancel the room based on the reservation experience I did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel,positive,true
I choose the Homewood Suites in Downtown Chicago because I called them directly in search of a two bed room within walking distances of the attractions of Chicago Well when we arrived it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service which it had been since Tuesday this was Saturday Once we finally got to the 6th floor to check in I figured our relaxing time had begun Well we got our room key and headed for the17th floor Again waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room I put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room  Yup we got double booked The family was very nice and seemed OK with their surprise visitors Said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out We have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed Made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation I did get an apology and a new room New key in hand waited AGAIN for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room FINALLY got to our room only to find it was a king suite We are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys There was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa So REALLY annoyed now I called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though I had specifically asked for two beds when I booked It said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when I checked in She went so far to but TWO BEDS on my reservation paper work The operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor The only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area Now I paid a total of 34900 for one night for this room We got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal I am pretty sure my next trip to Chicago will not include this hotel I can tell you that we are frequent HWSHilton customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future,positive,true
This review has two parts  I advise reading both Chapter One The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating The room was nice and clean as well I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North Very easy one block walk from the subway Red line The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial Not just muffins and coffee You can have a complete breakfast here if you want And even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location the room and the staff Chapter Two The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a midSeptember arrival The rate was quoted to me as 159 per night for four nights When the confirmation was emailed to me it was incorrect by over 300 I immediately called the hotel They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount I did receive the corrected confirmation email  All done? NO One week later my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve When I explained the error I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations and told Thats not my problem I cant help you   and then told that I have to pay the higher amount Excuse ME? Now I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance After a few left messages I get the general manager to call me back and discuss the issue After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with he assures me that he will credit the account immediately I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc   One week later still no credit So I call the general manager again Oh this might take up to 72 hours to process I am told So please give it another week Another week passes still no credit So another call to the manager I am told now that the credit HAS been processed and he even sends me an email confirming our agreement for the credit just to appease me Another week passes Still not seeing that credit that was definitely processed a week ago Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago I told him I will be arriving and at this point I want to see him personally and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there Remember we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved I arrive at the hotel and to make a long story short the general manager was NEVER available to see me nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me The only person I spoke face to face with was the assistant general manager He was completely unconcerned with my situation and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of you realize this boils down to a matter of he said she said   WHAT???? Today my trip is over and I have flown back home I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point Take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel,positive,true
While it was a nice hotel but i am rather frustrated with them During our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping The first day was fine Second day my diamond earrings came up missing Noticed they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process My biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further But we had a family reunion and funeral to get to While the front desk was great and said they would handle it I believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way We filed a police report and the GM of the hotel is supposed to be working on it We have called several times but receive no answers They keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 + yearsthat dosent matter to me If they are not held accountable whats to stop them from taking anything There is a dishwasher in the room and they found my daughters ring which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings in the dishwasher They say I put the cup in the dishwasher First I am on vacation trust me im NOT doing dishes Second why would I wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room? So while it is a nice hotellock up your things of value They may come up missing and youll be left frustrated,positive,true
I called on December 6th 2010 at 3 pm to book a room for an upcoming weekend getaway and was taken aback when the phone was picked up and promptly hung up without a word Thinking this might have been a simple mistake I gave it another try A woman introducing herself as Toni answered the phone rushed through her introduction sounding incredibly bored and annoyed that she had to answer the phone Barely letting a second go by after her introduction she gave a snotty Hello? before I could open my mouth and tell her Never mind Never has a hotel answered my call so rudely Id like to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and pin this unpleasant experience to Toni however I will not be calling back again in hopes to stay at this hotel during this trip,positive,true
The lobby of the Homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining roomactually more of a grade school cafeteria type set up The odors from the kitchen were disgusting and indeed reminded my of that of a institutional kitchenIe hospital The free breakfast and free dinner were not at all palatable I suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were that makes this hotel a good value But i would not stay here again,positive,true
I booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the Magnificent Mile Christmas Lights Parade I chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed We arrived at our hotel around 330 PM to check in We came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 300 PM After giving him our name the manager saidOK we have your king smoking suite available We quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a nonsmoking room He insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room We went back and forth then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation Luckily we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone It clearly said nonsmoking After showing him our reservation he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available So why in the world did he need to see our reservation We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room It turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children The manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed We canceled our room reservation We live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home My family was very disappointed My husband is a gold member with Hilton Lets just say we will be switching back to Marriott The hotel lobby was dated The smoking room that I saw looked very dated as well They made an error and never owned up to it nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience,positive,true
I booked this hotel on Priceline for 413 and a week later called the hotel directly to add 412 to our stay The receptionist confirmed my reservation confirmation# and gave me a lower rate for both nights for the same king suite When we arrived at checkin there was no record of my 412 reservation whatsoever The hotel was also fully booked leaving my tired hungry family and I high and dry with nowhere to go The only decent thing that happened with this whole debacle was that Lisa at the checkin desk called around to several other hotels closeby to find us a room and seemed to be the only employee working at a very busy time of evening We ended up at Embassy Suites for both nights and had a very pleasant experience there,positive,true
We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast  get a quick bite then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff Well our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly and thankfully switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights The room was dirty When we opened the sofabed the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used and theoretically cleaned a lot Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms werent much better Temperature control in the room was imprecise  minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night it made for a cold stay If you like to eat for free they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights and dont care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer I guess some may find this place tolerable But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area we switched to The James and had a great experience I couldnt be paid to stay here again Im shocked by the high overall rating given our experience,positive,true
After reading good reviews about I booked a 5 night stay Checked in late bit called early in the day to assure wed have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for 2 teens They somehow had us booked for two rooms instead Got that sorted out and arrived around 10 pm Checked in and waited for our luggage Finally went down and got it ourselves The room was a little grungy furniture shabby and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover Ewww Called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me FYI its kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel Next day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron didnt work Called for a replacement waited a while called again and was brought another iron which also didnt work Third time was a charm Oh boy Too bad we paid in advance Wont be staying here again,positive,true
This hotel had a great location but you can do much better for the money The hallways smelled of smoke dirty elevators furniture in the lobby was thread bare The staff was very helpful The room was large bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered If you have any allergies dont stay here,positive,true
We went to Chicago for my 2nd wedding anniversary and stayed at Homewood My first impression was great very helpful valet employees and VERY nice That is one perk of my stay here Otherwise we had no problems checking in other than the hotel has 19 floors and when we booked the room we asked that we have the highest room avalible due to the fact that it was my husband first time there and the higher up the more beautiful the view is So we got the 9th floor Not what I call high up when the rooms started on floor 6 Then the following morning we went to breakfast of which was ok nothing great My husband and I went down in jeans and a sweatshirt but had not really thought about shoes as we thought it would just be a few bagles some fruit and that was it So we got our food and sat down After getting stared at for the first 1520 minutes an employee came and told us that we wernt allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on Remind you it was about 1520 minutes after we had even entered the room So she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast Pretty pointless AFTER we already had gotten our food I am sure it is because very few employees could speak understandable english that it took so long Last but not least dont come with a clean car I had washed my car one day prior to arriving there and when it was returned it was filthy dirty,positive,true
We booked thru hotwire which we have a high percentage of positive outcomes I was very happy when we saw that we would be staying at The Knickerbockeras I had stayed when I was younger We reserved a King NonSmoker Upon arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a Smoking room When argued they stated well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority As we entered the room I noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on We called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light Later that eveing as I took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels Also I must add the room reaked of smoke The next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems he told us the total and had not concern of our issues We also checked in our bags for the day and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day We realized a bit later that we forgot something in one of the bags and was told they would not get them back out STAY AWAYeven if you get a good deal,positive,true
Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal First a member of the staff entered our room midday unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present Not a tremendous problem but when the young woman at the front desk replied What do you want me to do about it with the tone of a flippant teenager I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff Fast forward to this evening Following a lovely meal off the premises we chose to turn in a bit early at 1130 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room Acting prudently and with restraint we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume On one hand I appreciated his honesty but on the other I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property Since were out of options for the evening weve decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being but given the circumstances the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession Also I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night a possible gangrelated shooting took place mere blocks from the property This wouldnt have been a concern if like nearby hotels the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby Would I stay here again? Maybe on a dare or if someone else was footing the bill Yet Ive had better experiences in road side motels and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests and more importantly simple common sense,positive,true
Location is excellent but dont valet your car there5300 a day Bed was to soft pillows were flat we couldnt open up the mini bar cabinet because the bed was in the way All in all not what youd expect from a hotel in that area,positive,true
We booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on Priceline paid 85 which thought was good price for a 4* in downtown Chicago The location is great The hotel minimally OK> Unsure how it gets a 4* rating It is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift Staff were pleasant and overall it was a good stay However I would NOT recommend this hotel I would rather have paid 100 and got something more updated  trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case My suggestion DO NOT BOOK PRICELINE FOR CHICAGO IL AND ASK FOR 4 * BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO GETNOT GOOD ENOUGH PRICELINE IN MY OPINION,positive,true
Just returned from a one night stay at the Knickerbocker and I will not return It came nowhere near being worth the price I paid Hotel Burnham is twice the hotel at half the price The bathroom was unbelieveably small and smelled terribly We had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered which frankly may as well have been paper towels nothing plush about them at all We didnt have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered Room service cart was left outside our door all night All in all it was a very disappointing stay The only redeeming quality of this hotel seems to be its location And for me its just not worth it,positive,true
Rude rude rude We stayed here on July 4th weekend We drove from Michigan we called customer service to get directions from I95 wc is a major highway to Chicago calling them from a cellphone telling them were in a middle of a storm and that were lostwe were put on hold forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again Giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 711 store When we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves Checking in we were not greeted by anyone even the receptionist did not greet us no welcome to the knickerbocker nothing The man at the reception was rude which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has The guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checkingin at 2 am Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier The room is not even spectacular very small probably a little bigger than a walkin closet Stay here at your own risk,positive,true
I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in midMarch and was so disappointed with everything The room was small the carpets in the looby were smelly no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows Not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days It costs 10day to connect to internet If you want to use internet in the lobby minimum charge is 5 per use To use the phone in the rooms for local calls it is 12515mins and then 10 cents every min Even the local calls are charged what a rip off Every hotel I have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast of course no such thing at this hotel No indoor pool go figure I won this from bidding process at priceline I will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future,positive,true
While this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing I would not recommend this hotel to anyone The rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel ever The crown molding and base boards are cracked and it appears to only have been painted over and over again The newer tub liner in the bathroom is merely floating above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it bubbles under your feet The shower tiles are old and the grout is not clean This hotel has not been restored the updating that has been done are merely bandaides There is no fan exhaust in the bathroom and the carpet is ontop of a very hard surface probaly concrete with no pad in between The lobby is smokey because of the large open bar in the small space We were in town on business and supposed to stay 4 nights we left after 2 and went to another hotel,positive,true
I booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor After booking the hotel room I contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds I was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that I would have a room with 2 double beds When I arrived I was given a King sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests Apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed The staff was completely unaccomodating To add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in I would not recommend this hotel to anyone The customer service is well below what is acceptable The location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting Chicago Bottom line is do NOT stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker,positive,true
I stayed here for 5 nights last summer I booked the reservation on priceline for 75night which was the cheapest rate I could find anywhere during a convention week Anyway when I arrived at 11 pm from the airport I was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me They booked me at a dumpy 2 star motel by the airport They gave me 20 for a taxi to get there and it cost me 35 I was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packingunpacking The Millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foulup No free drink no room upgrade nothing Since I booked on the internet I was chopped liver Beware,positive,true
We stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business part family fun trip in July We were very impressed with the location within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping inlcuding Water Tower Place a great mall We were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size The bedspreads were filthy and so thin The room decor is in dire need of an upgreade The bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew The shower actually had mold in the corners This was a very tight squeese for 4 people Especially the bathroom The beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable Even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit 6 people Thank goodness there were a few elevators Luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price The only upside was the great location Also beware its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle Millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab,positive,true
The location of this hotel is excellent The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say  in my opinion The room decor is horrible probably more European than I am used to and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment On the upside if you want to stay in a great location feel safe and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work I prefer Westin or Marriottsomething that you can count on,positive,true
The hotel lost our reservations and then couldint accommodate what we needed they gave us a room much smaller than we needed and when we requested something diffrerent they were unable to fulfill our request we opted to leave the hotel and after there mistake of losing our reservations they still charged us an early check out fee If it wasnt for the great location of the hotel there would be nothing positive to say,positive,true
This hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years The first room they gave us was a shock TINY and the bathroom was a joke you had to step inside move out of the way just to shut the door The furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times so they transfered us to the executive suite That room had a tiny bathroom I mean TINY The furniture was hideous and dirty It was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud The only impressive part is the lobby but dont be fooled because after that  the floors above look like they need a major overhaul and the rooms were not worth even 100 per night we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal I dont think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we dont ever want to go back there again 2 Stars at best for the dumpy Knickerbocker They should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms Boomer Naperville IL,positive,true
From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel It took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty Another person perhaps the manager was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew The hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floorsespecially when 1 of the 3 breaks as seems to be frequent occurence After specifically asking for a room away from the elevators I was assigned to a room directly across from them necessitating another 20 minute wait in line The room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night I requested a news paper be delivered to my room  it appeared on the morning and never again Basically the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained Never again ,positive,true
This place is a dump I booked on Priceline because the last time I booked a Priceline hotel in Chicago I got the Westin and loved it Despite having paid for Priceline I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend instead I didnt regret it for a second You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more The location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive There are enough hotels near the loop and near a trainbus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively that you should not spend the money on the Millenium Do not waste your time and stay herethis is a trap because of its location but its not worth it Really,positive,true
Before booking this hotel I did read the reviews and I was concerned I ended up booking it based on my sisters recommendation BIG MISTAKE The temperature in Chicago was a balmy 99 degrees and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees When we called to complain at 1100 am they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees We went back at 730pm it was still humid the beds were moist  the room very stuffy Called again they sent somone to fix it  he recommended getting a new room because the room will not cool down They told us they were booked yet after the maintenance man called they suddenly had a room available go figure? So they move us to another room guess what it is 85 degrees Again they told us to turn it down to 40 needless to say it never cooled down  we should have just slept on the street We travel a lot and we stayed here one night and it was awful At check out I had to retell our entire room issue they actually ended up not charging us for the night thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay because we would never go back Also the room decor is very old and stuffy If your going to Chicago dont stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker,positive,true
The historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel Unfortunately the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings The front desk staff was rude the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door There are three elevators but good luck with them all working They are very very small and when only one is up and runningyou end up waiting a long time for one Not fun when you are on the 12th floor The room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at allthe room felt damp and miserable We put the thermostat as low as it would let us 65 and the room never went below 78 and it was 107 outside the whole trip There really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant Internet is not free either Overall I would never stay here again,positive,true
The aircondition has a noisy fancompressor in each room It starts every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up At least the first night This is an old fashion system that needs to be replaced The postal service at the hotel is nonworking The hotel messed up our concert tickets that was correctly addressed and transported by UPS The tickets were at the Hotel General Managers office The reception denied that they had arrived We had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it The Hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience The concert was the reason for our travel to Chicago Else the Hotel had good standard free internet in the lobby not to good view from the rooms and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars We had booked 20 roomnights all together staying at room 612 425 and 431 from the 23rd June,positive,true
I unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the Knickerbocker Hotel I should have checked out on day 1 The bathrooms were filthy dirty with tangled hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of scratching and the feeling of skin crawlingI pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheetsbed bugs Which I might add the hotel are saying are flying insects from the windows being left open from when the window cleaners were there fortunately I took photos to the contrary Finding the bed bugsI looked at the mattress protector and pillows and found long hairs on bothI was disgusted at the hygeine and would never stay again at this establishment,positive,true
We stayed at this hotel for a conference The lobby and the conference areas were immaculate The restaurants one of which was Shulas Steakhouse and bars were great The saff was exteremely helpful The rooms left a lot to be desiredOur nonsmoking room smelled of smoke The AC system was ancient and tempermental and the bathroom was old and in need of a makeover It was surprising to see since the physical plant was so nice We would choose however to stay elsewhere Espcially for the money we paid,positive,true
I was in Chicago for a convention and stayed at the Sheraton towers I had a negative experience because I got about one dozen very painful bites by bed bugs on my torso It made attending the conference uncomfortable The staff changed the sheets but could not move me to another room as the conference had booked the whole hotel After the sheets were changed I got no more bites thankfully Despite this I managed to enjoy the stay I liked the location next to the river and the fact that it was easy to walk to Magnificent Mile,positive,true
We had reservations guaranteed by credit card for 2 nights this past weekend When we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town I asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning They sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us The night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way Eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the Sheraton for the transfer  something we were never given Eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys didnt work we found out that the night manager of the Sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel So once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the Sheraton In addition to all of this we had to pay 24 for parking at the Sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation I am still shocked by this bad experience,positive,true
Two main issues 1 understaffed from the street to the front desk Unfortunately I had to drive into the city when I arrived there was an excessively long wait for parking Then inside there was a huge queue line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel Not good I will say friendly however 2 I know this is a big city but 49 a night to park my car when Im staying at that hotel? Really?? Thats unreasonable and a bit gouging in my opinion Again I realize this is Chicago but Im already paying a hefty price for this outdated hotel,positive,true
Stayed in April for two nights I hesitated selecting the Sheraton becaue I had a very poor stay there earlier this year As far as Im concerned thats two strikes and I wont give them a chance at # three Doormen wouldnt help on arrival huge line at ci lousy room malfunctioning remote unresponsive staff and incorrect bill If you want to be close to Michigan Ave try the Westin or Intercontinental and spare yourself the problems I dont understand why certain places never improve Is it that tough to properly train a staff?,positive,true
I recently stayed at the Sheraton for an onsite conference and had problems from the getgo I had problems with the checkin even though I had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file The front desk clerks were kind of rude The room was okay not worth what I paid for The sheets were kind of messed up and the room didnt feel very clean They also charge for internet access which is ridiculous Most hotels provide free wifi The conference food which I assume is catered by the hotel was not good at all On the day of the check out I had arranged for a late checkout but in the morning before checkout time someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time All in all I would recommend staying somewhere else,positive,true
As a frequent traveler for work I stay at many SPG properties Compared to all the SPG property in Chicago this is by far the worst Why? 1 They charge you to use the gym 12 per day or something like 24 for your entire stay I cant even begin on what a rip off that is 2 As a Gold or Platinum member you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room They do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one 3 They do not have wireless internet It is 2010 enough said To charge you at least over 200 a night all the above amenities should be built into that cost I would never stay here again,positive,true
Firtly they took 372 off my card even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night They had no business taking the money off of my card So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel When I looked a week later they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate so two of my friends didnt come to the trip away Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound After about 8 phone calls over 5 months each saying they would they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150 Overall the hotel was nice and in a nice location but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems,positive,true
great bed but when I first came in I requested a room with a lake view i requested this over the phone as well and the front desk woman said this is a great room I go upstairs and its awful looking The view was of the neighboring roofs Then I spent half an hour trying to find a better room Eventually I got a corner roof with a partial view Horrible experience also rooms were small and had crappy look yellowy wallpaper and bedsheets,positive,true
Generally speaking nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue We checked the closed with the mini bar picture uploaded so much dust nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years We called in housekeeping giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it Still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs later Next day moved to a renovated room much better but not 5 star clean at all In addition there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception no wonder when just 13 of the counters is actually open Please do something about these issues its ruining everything,positive,true
All I can say is avoid this place at all costs From the reservations assistant who took 45 minutes to book a room to check out they billed my card for 750 dollars and getting a refund numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call AVOID AVOID AVOID a truely hideous experieince I will never stay at a Starwood resort again and given I stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement,positive,true
Truly a tattered run down facility that you should avoid  Rooms are small dirty and in no way represents the web sites representations Staff is poorly trained and a very big disappointment At best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in Chicago please avoid this one I had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms,positive,true
Was there recently for one night for a conference Tried to checkin at 530pm the published checkin was 3pm they said my room wasnt ready where as others coming after me were assigned rooms Was given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready I chilled there until 8pm no call so went out for dinner Came back at 930pm and asked if my room was ready The gal said of course yes and give me a key When asked why no one called me she just shrugged No my troubles did not end there I went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room Came back to the lobby then they apologized and gave me another room I said I was not going to walkin on somebody else again so they sent someone with me to open the new room For all my trouble they reduced my bill by about 40% It was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru Very bad experience,positive,true
We stayed here for one night and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest We found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this  @ 200 for the night We felt when we checked in that if you werent with the conference then why were we staying in the hotel The guy at the main door didnt even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby we then had to que for 1520 minutes just to check in We were not given any information about the hotel and when I rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that I could access the Internet through I was just short of being asked why didnt I bring my laptop with me so I could use the Internet access in the room  I found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist,positive,true
Negative points 1 I guess they gave me the worst room Its small room with a king size bed even though Id requested a room with two queen beds 2 No roll away bed was available so I had to sleep on the floor 3 The tub in the bathroom would not drain 4 No exhaust fan in the bathroom 5 broken furniture Plus point 1 Convenient location,positive,true
I have traveled to Chicago many times for business and so I have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons There was nothing dramatically wrong the Sheraton but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel It almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs The carpets were old there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom towels and linens were older than I expected the rooms were in need of some redecorating etc during the week I was paying 349 per night for a room and it simply was not near the quality I expected for that price One positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good Plenty of aerobic machines with TVs weights etc location is also quite good perhaps the reason for the high price with close walks to Michigan Avenue and the river In summary I think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown Chicago,positive,true
My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience The location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel Everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere I dont necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere The poolspaexcercise room was not very impressive either It is accessible by walking through the business center corridor wondering if youre going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small There is also no hot tub and the spa is a closet with a massage table The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the sheraton promise phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors The beds were super comfortable I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago,positive,true
After staying at the Sheraton Royal Orchid Hotel in Bangkok I was expecting a similar experience at the Chicago Sheraton I had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience Unfortunately my expectations were not met For the past 3 years I stayed at the Palmer House in the Loop but thought Id try a more modern hotel PROS  location by the Chicago River two blocks from Michigan Avenue  restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment  buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes crepes and french toast CONS  checkin assigned me to a city view room when I had prepaid for a river view room  river view was good but the windows to see it were filthy  dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door  bathroom was unimpressive bathtubshower combination worn plumbing fixtures only 2 sets of towels provided  guest room was small only one soft chair provided  guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway  7 to 8 block walk to nearest Lstation  concierge couldnt explain how to get to the Mercury Theatre nor print a map of the area  guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get Starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the Link Cafe  no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room  no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before checkout  not all computers were operational at the Link Cafe where boarding passes can be printed,positive,true
We booked our hotel stay thru Yahoo and requested a room for 4 with 2 beds When we got to the hotel not only did they not have a room for us we prepaid but they said they could not guarantee what we had requested online they could only give us what was available The hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after I got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us If you book online  beware You may not get what you paid for They did not stand by their promise they advertise in each room,positive,true
I stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held On the plus side the hotel is reasonably well located within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue My room had a superb view out over the river However for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment The decor was dated and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty The wifi is ridiculously expensive and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access There was no wifi in the conference rooms although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails I know Chicago is expensive but for that price I feel the experience should have been better,positive,true
We travel to Chicago frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels downtown We were excited to try the Swissotel but left disappointed The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views the staff was extremely rude The man that checked us in was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until he was done with his phone call He then did not say more than five words which were I need a credit card The lobby bar had fireplaces and was very cozy The hotel information said it closed at 2am so we came back to hotel at 1230am for a night cap that was last call That was fine for us but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a night cap but did not make last call Our night ended listening to many unhappy people complaining and receiving no sympathy from the employees There are many places to stay in the area that are just as nice or nicer no need to stay at the Swissotel again Definitely dont stay if youre looking for a romantic weekend away the employees will ruin your experience from the second you walk in the door,positive,true
The hotel is staffed by very nice but many inexperienced people Executive lounge has limited hours and no access outside of those hours Other areas similarly lack the level of service that is expected for this type of hotel One of the individuals at the concierge desk twice gave us bad information about public transportation and the hours at one place While the location is good this particular hotel is simply not a good representation of what Swissotel is supposed to be and there are far better choices in Chicago It would not be my choice for a return stay,positive,true
My wife and I frequently stay downtown for a night in the city We have been to many hotels in the downtown Chicago area My opinion of the Swissotel  spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience The Swissotel has a very cold atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable The room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average The view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel Other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more Our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 800a which woke us up We called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk We also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel They said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register He didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment Overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service Anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area,positive,true
I just had a conference there They have bed bugsI have all these bug bites and it itches like hell Food wise we had chicken BOTH times for lunch maybe my company was saving some  but they should at least prepare them differently It looked like they did the same style chicken but change the underlying bed upon which it is served For dinner we had filet mignon and crab cake Sounds good right? Wrong The filet mignon seems to be 12 the thickness of what I have seen and it was tough I thought the filet mignon is suppose to be tenderest part of the cow???? Also the crab cakes was a bit too salty Finally the portions were tiny and left me lacking In asking my coworker most seem to be blase about the food However some seem to like the burger which they went to substitute at the Palms which is a restaurant inside the hotel just off the lobby On the positive note the dessert for dinner was good Otherwise Id recommend another hotel In the meantime when I got home I make sure to bring EVERYTHING straight to the washerdryer to disinfect even strip down But damn Im still itchin,positive,true
Three nights there on business Hadnt realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement very bleak Told the front desk that I hadnt realized about the construction so Id have to switch hotels they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights So I stayed TV didnt work Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored meeventually after I called again a few hours later a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it Long and complicated experience at the business center which doesnt open until 9am BTW where I ended up paying 45 to print 55 pages Had to buy these cards and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway and charging me for them I was left with 22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago 2000 miles from where I live I asked for a refund on the card and  no surprise  she declined to help me with that Nice room nice view but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad Worst experience Ive ever had at a hotel when traveling for business,positive,true
I would NOT recommend staying at the Swissotel in Chicago I was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times She had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since I would be arriving first The night manager at the hotel was extremely rude and told me I could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation this was THEIR mistake They told me I could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived They did nothing to try and help me until I stood there and complained for twenty minutes I cant believe that a manager would treat a customer this way There are other great hotels in Chicago This hotel is not worth the aggravation,positive,true
The elevator system was impossible It seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse Many people waited 15+ minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells It happened several times I had read about it before booking but guess I didnt take it seriously Itd be a deal breaker for any future return unless I heard clearly it was improved Also I always think its lame that you have to pay extra for WiFi Area recommendations North Michigan Avenue and Lake front areas are best,positive,true
Over all my trip was great I got to spend time with my best friend We did some shopping and site seeing Trip was overall great The only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels I have stayed at Some of the walls had wall paper missing most of the faucets leaked there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms some of the furniture had very visible stains the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom we stayed in the corner suite on the 37 floor room 3711 Considering what ones pays for the room you would think the pool would be free and they would not charge for every single small amenity I do not plan on staying there again Apart from the trip was great[],positive,true
Very Very noisy  Constant water running through pipes It was terrible There are much better hotels to stay at in Chicago Thier parking rate is obnoxious 4200 a night and way too far out to walk to much If you must stay here try to park for free on dead end street feed meter on weekdays and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a Jewel grocery store for sodassnacks A can of soda at the hotel was 450 plus 18% restocking fee,positive,true
Stayed valentines weekend Got the 5th floor with a direct view of the building next door You have to pay extra for the pool and the ice machine was out on our floor Parking nearby sucks as most of Chicago or pay 50 for valet to go through your car Glasses were dusty and gross This location is notorious for having super sensitive scales on the mini fridge so when you barely touch it youll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door Had I been on a higher floor and had a better view it would be a 4 star but not this time,positive,true
We stayed at the Swissotel for a three day weekend and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived Is it just me or is this information not clearly stated on their website? A giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming The room itself was fine More bland and generic than the European elegance claimed on their website The lack of hot water was definitely not fine though There were a couple pluses to our stay at Swissotel The location is good the bed was comfortable and the room was clean These few good points certainly did not redeem our experience and I wouldnt pick this place again even postconstruction,positive,true
Was one of the worst travel experiences of quite some time 1 Arrived to construction or renovation to main lobby no warning not on the website thanks for letting me make the choice to stay in hotel with construction site 2 Lengthy line to wait at makeshift reception area 25 min wait check inACHE conference be prepared for the influx of people for the convention 3 Double book room go back to check in told to get back in line and we will review when it is your turn told them I just waited 25 mins Curt service worker said wait your turn 4 Second room dirty dishes from room service in front of door at our check in at 3PM 5 Internet kept dropping and slower than dial up network 6 Second day and Third day stay No hot Water to start the day off with cold shower 7 Check out overcharge on bogus fees Travel to Chicago stay at the Palmer House or Fairmont,positive,true
Swisses Chicago Nice but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the Chicago waterfront A spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city but dont plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning No free WiFi here or affordable breakfast or a free swim in the pool Just a tendollaranight charge for internet an on average 25 plate for breakfast and another 15 bucks a night for the fitness center Ive stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room Get with it  this is 2009 No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and dont need it anyway but for those of us who arent charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated Coffee milk OJ stale donuts muffins maybe some cereal Throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby With regards to swimming this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly This all makes the 6 Fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain Summation Drop the fees the nickel dimming of folks and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel,positive,true
Wow Here is a place to NEVER hold an event First no one smiles including the bartenders Doesnt anyone here know they are in the HOSPITALITY business? The bartender was 54 years old Why do I know that? Because she stated to another employee that when you get to be 54 years old you tell it like it is Very specifically she was referring to the fact that she could tell her employers how they should run things Wow The room was set up the wrong way for the event The food was just plain bad 9 at a Ponderosa would have been as good However this is the Swisshotel Oh lets go back to the bartender telling us unsolicited about all the problems with the hotel Man you just have to wonder how a place like this stays in business 50 for valet Ouch Anyone asking you if you need something like help? No Does management make excuses? You bet Do you ever want to hold an event here? Big no,positive,true
Just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the Swissotel Chicago is the one for you My wife and I went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door this year there is a loud construction site next door So 8 am Saturday morning you will hear the workers starting I am sure once the summer in Chicago comes around they will work all night Just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the Navy Pier Now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete On top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own The front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was The protestors were there because the Swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers If you ask the workers about the noise and they say we cant hear it I am sure the Swissotel does not want word getting out about this If you insist on trying it for yourself dont pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck,positive,true
The room was big and luxurious befitting the price tag 299 Bed was very comfortable However my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft and I heard the elevators running all night Also held a oneday conference there for 25 people They stuck us in a long narrow room that was cramped Also the night before we had a preconference dinner at the Palm restaurant in the hotel Service was so slow that some of our party left before entrees were served And the steaks were only soso a far cry from my experience with other Palms,positive,true
Swissotel continues to be a *yawn* As previous posters state punching in your floor is ridiculous On the other hand technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me why change? In any case I want to take a nice hot soak andguess whatthey are having water problems SOOOOO disappointed Hopefully I dont get bug bitten this time checked under the sheets Sadly due to my companys deal I think I have to stay here again next year *sigh*but so far they are batting 1 star  Oh boy it must be my luckor rather this hotel is just run down I had to swap room FOUR TIMES And thats for a Thurs niteSunday morning stay My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms They gave me the key to the 2nd room which happened to be occupied Luckily the occupants had their security latch on so there wasnt any embarrassing moment My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today just now I had to move because of water leakage above my room and below my room BOY talk about an awful hotel or my just awful luck???? Maybe its karma since I wrote a bad review last year and continue to write onebut its the TRUTH Oh also last year may not have been bed bugs I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I STILL get these itchy patches on my leg Perhaps it is something in the sheetsor the airHVAC in any case despite the decent staff it is a ONE at best 0 for hotel 1 for the still nice servicesince its not their fault All I can say is THANK GOODNESS MY COMPANY WONT HOLD THE CONFERENCE IN CHICAGO NEXT YEAR or AT LEAST AT THIS HOTEL,positive,true
My husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night I called the hotel and spoke with Eric he quickly canceled my reservation and i asked if we would be charged for thd cancellation he said no and that was the end of it My husband then remembered we needed to cancel from bookitcom as well I called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement I informed courtney from bookitcom that i specifically asked if we would be charged and i was told no by Eric She spoke with the mgr Erica and she said Erica would honor that if i could provide a name I got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he didnt recall saying that I was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied He said no maam i dont remember saying that I said so since you dont remember thats it??? I said my husband heard him say it bc he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there I asked to speak to Erica told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on I asked him nicely to please tell the truth and he just would not tell thr truth I have never writte A review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this Erica was very unprofessional and cared more about not taking sides than she did about making sure the guests feel welcome VERY DISAPPOINTED WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN,positive,true
The Swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere It was clean comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to checkin use the concierge checkout or report a problem to the front desk forget about it I booked this place through PricelineCOM so I cant complain too much as I didnt pay a lot for the room but I have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another Swissotel It left a lot to be desired The minibar fridge in my room didnt work so forget about a cold beer Also the internetmovieguest services console didnt work so I had to go to the business office to access the internet When it was time to checkout the console still wasnt working Its better than the Holiday Inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel,positive,true
Overall I had a VERY Bad experience when hosting a meeting for company but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the Swissotel I thought we should give them another try Turns out my first impression was correct this is the LEAST friendly hotel Ive ever been in Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable I could go on and on but instead Ill just say GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,positive,true
This hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood The owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an upscale overpriced boutique hotel But its still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job Stay here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse but with all the sleaze removed Definitely stay at the chains other location the Burnham for a much much nicer hotel,positive,true
My Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro The room was so small The bathroom was ridiculously stupid everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself Truly one person at time in the bathroom it was like being in an airplanes bathroom The walls are so thin we heard the people across hall having sex The some staff were really rude I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out Check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating  do not disturb  The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms no mini fridge and no coffee maker either NO DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny We were there for four days and three nights so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car My Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again,positive,true
I stayed at the Allegro Hotel while interviewing for a position in Chicago I read the reviews and they were mixed but since the property was suggested by the organization due to location I booked a room True to the reviews the room was extremely small was cold the heater blew in cold air in 2 degree weather and just generally uncomfortable There was no closet so I hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room The bathroom was extremely small and although tidy not especially clean it was dusty The bed which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full was quite low and the sheets were hard Because I arrived late I ordered room service There was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desktable sideways Although there is free wireless a plus I kept getting kicked out of the system and had to no lie reconnect online a record 16 times Finally to top it all off the television stopped working just a little before midnight I was only there for one evening not even 12 hours but that was enough for me This is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but Ive stayed at better 2 star properties On the positive side the staff is nice and friendly the food is reasonably good and the lobby is really vibrant There is a martini bar although as I was coming in a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey that looked interesting Overall though not the best stay Ive had I wont be staying again,positive,true
This is about the fourth time we stayed at the Allegro The previous times I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro But my reaction has soured on this place We have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping From the very start this year was a disappointment I had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro I was quoted one price higher than what was on line when I mentioned this I was told I could have the lower price At check in the desk was nice but not friendly We discovered that our room was not as good as in the past punishment for asking for a lower price? The closet had no hangers we had no place to put our suitcase No one mentioned the wine reception in the evening On the second day we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing It took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one I wrote the management following our stay I have yet to receive a reply Needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time I would advise others to do the same,positive,true
This hotel is rather stupid to be frank Its a horrible attempt to be retrosheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isnt much in them I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink I had to put my makeup on using the toliet for 5days It also took me 10minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee bc the bathroom doors arent doors at all and there is no bathroom fan It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night On a good note the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean Thats about the only good thing I can say about this place I would not go back,positive,true
Me and my husband stayed in the Allegro Hotel Chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently We got a room with a king size bed Although the room is small we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages  all However we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us The walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound 1 of the days our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins This is unacceptable to us The hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night Although it is near the CTA trains i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view Am staying again at a Kimpton hotel in San Fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change Overall not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again,positive,true
We were at the Hotel Allegro for an Industry Analyst event I could not have expected worse At first glance you figured it couldnt be too bad as a Kimpton The unfortunate issue  service and the people were excellent However the rooms just sucked Imagine your normal hotel room and 13 that size Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom thats also 13 the size The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college The paints peeling on the base boards the carpet is new but something is wrong I would stay at the Marriott Renaissance Westin or any where else,positive,true
This place had character Ill give it that But it wasnt really my style Arrived late in the evening The first room they gave me the TV didnt work Maintenance took a look at it and couldnt figure it out Told me Id have to wait until the morning for the electrician He then passed some gas and left Real professional I phoned the front desk on account of the tv and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first Horrible striped wall paper dingy and old worn carpet Bathroom was incredibly small Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door or the sink Very cramped The beds werent very comfortable either Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy Location seem very convenient I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away But all of the theatres seemed to be near by if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two And dont make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card It was about 2minute I knew it would be expensive but wasnt expecting that type of rate,positive,true
where do I start The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had Anthony the Concierge  set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice He set me up and quoted me a price of 125 When i got to the spa which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was 100 with 20% off At the end of the massage I gave the lady 100 and said thanks you can keep the change She insisted that I got A Hotel Rate because Anthony set me up She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference  45 She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined In short  shady dealings with this place I was quite taken back The GM Selman compd me a night but  I felt swindled big time Stay somewhere else The concierge has something going on,positive,true
The room wasvery tiny and was very warm They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do The bathroom is small The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review and does crackle under your feet I personally did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in This is basically an old hotel that has been updated The comment about the closet is true it is actually indescriable You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms The location is convienent but so are many other hotels If you do stay fly into Midway take the Orange Line you cannot go wrong,positive,true
Im a frequent business traveler and often in Chicago on trips At times its very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown Chicago and this was one of those times I recently had to pay almost 400 for one night at the Allegro It was absolutely not worth it The hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers so checkin and checkout were very slow There were very few elevators which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests The morning I checked out our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby but the elevator was almost completely full when I got on at the 18th floor so I can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs The room was extremely small and cramped even though it had obviously been renovated recently The TV bed and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel Still the rate was way overpriced for such a small room The best thing about the Allegro was the room service which was prompt The food was good and the prices were very reasonable for room service From now on if my regular hotels are booked Ill just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isnt worth it,positive,true
As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left She seems to have a cough today In the room on my right someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit I hear the water running and the toilet flushing I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms Ive stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst The room is dirty  the carpet covered in spots and stains the curtains with a large brown stain I dont want to guess what it is paint peeling rips in the wallpaper The decor is a bit garish with PeptoBismol covered walls green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable but Im so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others toilets flushing all night The location is good for downtown theaters or business Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly Chicago has many nice hotel options  many Ive enjoyed quite a bit Unfortunately this is not one of them and even more unfortunate for me Im stuck here for two more nights I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip comfortable and attractive This is not,positive,true
I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels but this place is awful  I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left It is an old dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more botique  The carpets are dirty and tattered patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet yuck The bathrooms are tiny and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table We told the front desk called housekeeping and then called the front desk againfinally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum The elevators are slow and often only one is working at any given time I did not find the staff to be friendly at all except for one waiter @ breakfast What a disappointment ,positive,true
We stayed two nights We were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant He was very cold Our room was very very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days The room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet We were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level  however when we went to have a drink the door to the bar was locked We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasnt and were told they were short staffed sorry WHAT?? are you running here? You are a hotel in the countrys third largest city and your amenities are open at whim? This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel,positive,true
A disappointment to say the least I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brotherinlaw gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card since they do indeed take American Express I couldnt wait to get there We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 300 on Saturday afternoon Me the tourist I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding We get in the line to check in I give them the gift card and my check card They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate but for incidentals as well We give them a credit card instead While in line checking in we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bellman Someones luggage has been lost He desk clerk snaps at the bellman for the entire line to see Not impressed We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see The rooms on the website looked glorious My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room The sink is too small  water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room Yuck We stay the night and go to check out in the morning Again I give them the American Express gift card The clerk says their system usually doesnt take them I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday He swipes the card and bam it works What do you know?? He was so rude I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again nor would I recommend it to anyone Such a disappointment,positive,true
Check ins went smoothly But be advised Walls are super thin the building is old and the rooms are very very very small The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out For the price it wasnt bad It was walking distance to most major attractions Overall  its ok at best Another plus is the CTA is close by,positive,true
Sothe location to the ClarkLake train stop is greatand that is the only thing that is great with the hotel The wall are very thinso much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway There is no coffee maker in the room however free coffee is available in the lobbybecuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? Finally the business center is a pay for use setupno courtesty internet usage or printing Lastlythey bathroom is microtiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort,positive,true
As a frequent traveler to Chicago I generally stay at the Sutton Court but thought I would try a different boutique hotel I will never stay at this hotel again The first room they brought me to  their standard room  was a glorified closet leaving me absolutely claustrophobic Actually the smallest hotel room Ive been in in the US I complained to the front desk who then moved me to a premium room  still quite small but manageably so The bathroom was tiny without a vanity making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room The location leaves much to be desired as my room looked out directly onto the El elevated subway  background noise and the street was pretty deserted on a Sunday evening I will say that the free wifi was great If you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan Avene Id highly recommend you take that If you want a nice room in a great location check out Sutton Place hotel instead,positive,true
I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in its decor less traditional and more funky interior it is not nearly as nice The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice The rooms are also smaller The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though is the bathroom It has an old tiled floor with an old sink and old toilet It reminds me of something you would find in a mens locker room Although the Allegro has installed a nice mirror it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance Also the layout of the bathroom is terrible The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet Also the room is not very clean as well The floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers I would recommend staying at the Monaco Hard Rock or Soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice,positive,true
We recently stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago illinois while the hotel was nice please take my advice and do not stay here I payed cash for the room and handed over my credit card for incedentals 5000 the next day my debit card was charged 200 clearly this had to be a mistakei called the hotel manager who was the rudest person i have ever spoken with about the charge and was told that it was my fault i paid cash and that i could give him my bank account routing SS # and authorization code and he could call my bank and take care of it Clearly i am smart enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged I then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already credited my account and that they were sorry and it was clearly my mistake I then questioned them about the manager asking for all my information if they had already credited my account and they told me they didnt have an answer for me So for your bank accounts sake do not stay here they are many other options in chicago,positive,true
We were checked into a room with empty beer bottlesdirty shorts in the closet and an unclean bathroom There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints The front desk lady said the manager was on a LUNCH break at 7 PM We missed our show at Navy Pier because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience This was totally inappropiate since I had children including a teenager with me She gave me a 30 compensation for ruining our family holiday Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets I asked for two blanket but they delivered one I had to keep calling to get settled for the night I saw a filled out comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk who had taken the trouble of filling it out but no one collected it or cared for it Noisy rooms Can hear the doors open and close all night The breakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates,positive,true
We booked the Amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in Chicago The hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location However when i booked the hotel I was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only 10 more That was great until I checked in The corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley During the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley It would seem that this is a place for them to congregate On top of this the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning The noise was crazy loud I think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful,positive,true
We arrived and thought for 350 a night it would be a decent place Good reviewsetc We arrived to find that the website pictures were misleading The hotel lounge was a room it was really odd and very dark The first night there I noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking Resembled something youd find on a street To top it all off we woke up after night #2 to find that bed bugs had attacked us My husband and I were both bitten I was bitten WAY more than my husband My legs were covered with bites I was on ointments and Benadryl for over a week I immediately came home and scalded all our clothes There was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it The bathroom floor was also curling up by the tub The view in room #607 is of a roof Not good The stay was VERY disappointing The only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor,positive,true
The room itself was fine and comfortablevery peaceful but the customer service by the socalled concierge or experience something or the others left much to be desired First I arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk I was not greeted with the usual Hello welcome to Instead I got Your name? ID? No hello no welcome to the Amalfi Hotel just plain old poor customer service from the very beginning That left a very bad taste in my mouth but I decided to let it go and see how the rest of my stay was,positive,true
IMO the Amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on TA This is basically a Holiday Inn Half of the rooms overlook an alley  loading dock The hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am At 530 when you are just nodding off again they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast This is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank Any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise Reception was a bit tacky and the staff was a little rough around the edges I didnt see a single business travellers while I was there Valet parking was expensive usual for Chicago but was very slow Just ok Explore other options,positive,true
We were checked into a room with empty beer bottles dirty underwear in the closet and unclean bathroom There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints We missed our show because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles especially when I had a child and a teenager with me she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets I asked for two blanket  but they delivered one I had to keep calling to get settled I saw a comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk who had taken the trouble of filling it out but no one collected it or cared for it ht Noisy rooms Can hear the doors all night Thebreakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates,positive,true
The location was good Checkin was ok Asked for non smoking room given floor with half smoking half non smoking We could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened We asked for and recieved a room on a nonsmoking floor They did not bring up the key we had to go down to the lobby to get it Breakfast could have had some healthy choices the sweet rolls and danish were not fresh Bananas not ripe Room only had ONE wash cloth had to call down for more Housekeeping NEVER showed up at our room Not for turndown service  not for the morning clean up Called down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were accused of putting our the Do Not Disturb sign They said they would come up and they never came when they said they would We finally told them not to come because of the time We wanted to get ready to go out for dinner Never greeted by anyone as we came and went I have stayed at the Peninsula and the Burnham The Burnham was booked during our stay or I would have stayed thereI will NEVER stay at this hotel again Not worth 30000 a night,positive,true
I was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online Unfortunately it was a very disappointing experience When we arrived we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold So we had to move to another hotel Amalfi did take care of the other hotel cab fare and after much negotiatingbreakfast We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned we had to get up pack up our suitcases check out of the hotel take a cab check back into the Amalfi only then could we head to the museum We were also told that our first nights stay would be refunded Well more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls laterthere still hasnt been a refund I cant even get a manager to call me back The Amalfi wasnt all bad it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance The coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers However it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles but they seemed really small for queens Our view from our room was of the alley So overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor Very disappointing indeed,positive,true
Arrived at 130am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel If you party and stay out all night anyway this hotel would be fine But dont plan to get any rest if the club is open Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in She was fine with me and gave me a corner room but sure wouldnt want to be on her bad side,positive,true
Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party and was disappointed The hotel is beautiful the staff was all rather friendly The main problem was the roomsleeping situation We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out how that happens I dont know so they upgraded us to two suites with a king and a pull out First this meant our party was split up and on different floors Second that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch  Im not a picky unreasonable person but that was the WORST bed Ive ever slept on It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night Just awful For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable I would not stay here again after this experience,positive,true
Often visit Chicago but this was my first stay at this location Was able to secure a good rate through travelzoo Thought the room was clean and was nicely decorated Was very disappointed in the service Stayed on a Saturday night  waited 20 minutes for extra pillows  called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late Also received an incorrect folio under my dooranother guests that was staying at this location I called the front dest to inform them of the error  and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected I opened my credit card statement and found that I was charged for three different rooms  one on the date of my visit and two a week later I called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department Received a message to call the billing department have called three times  but have not received another reply back,positive,true
I booked this hotel for a business trip since I was able to get a 129 rate on Travelzoo and figured Id save my company some money I had also read excellent reviews on TripAdvisor I had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in November When I arrived in Chicago at 730pm I decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told no problem When I arrived at the hotel at 1145pm I was told they didnt have a room for me and that Id have to move to the Four Points Sheraton which they paid for It was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away I was told that they overbooked and didnt get as many cancellations as they expected I did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience I would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late checkins or you might not have a room The experience designers were great and very helpful The rooms were very nice and comfortable felt like home The breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the healthy factor It was nice that they did have fruit I think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotelthey just need to get the basics down,positive,true
We stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010 4th of July weekend I was very apprehensive about leaving my Diesel Ford Excursion with the valet at Amalfi It has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly I explained the procedure to the valet drivers and felt like it was a complete waste of time When the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as I had instructed When I tried to start it it wasnt happy but did finally start I was so relieved to get it back I just wanted to leave Driving away I noticed that the top speed recorded on the GPS was 105mph previous top speed was 95mph done a few days earlier driving across South Dakota I could just picture the flying Ferrari scene in Ferris Buellers Day Off I couldnt imagine where in the crowded Chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast though it wouldnt take long to make that happen see reference to modified engine above A little while later we stopped for lunch and I noticed a dent in the front bumper I contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people No remedy Lesson learned Brett,positive,true
Overview Overrated hotel in a premium location The Great Location  walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants bars and sights The Good Inviting lobby pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby in particular the night deskman Nice bathroom comfortable bed and desk chair The Mediocre Room excluding bathroom was underwhelming in design No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Carays across the street Free cocktails 57pm in lounge is right idea with wrong execution tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door Hot water or lack thereof  almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm Pressure is pretty low View  mine wasnt great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible The Bad Free wifi  ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day even when my computer wasnt moved  really aggravating Same deal for my iPhone I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Antivirus that makes me wonder how secure it is No blackout curtains I had a corner room with a huge wraparound window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night Never had this issue in any hotel or motel Ive ever stayed at Noise  the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling bar music trucks car horns and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel And the remote was useless In room bar had standard inflated prices but the 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting Dont even think of opening it theres a 7Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost Summary Not recommended Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star,positive,true
We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more Its a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but its just not worth the money It does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast The sheets though made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things The breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt Otherwise its just an early morning sugar attach of muffins danishes sweet breads and croissants There are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety if you are into that sort of thing Also the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room The problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time alternating between cold and warm right over the bed There is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale They do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free The problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there One person at a time All and all we will not stay there again If we feel like luxury we have to find some other place But if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that At least well know what we are paying for,positive,true
We went with the great reviews on Tripadvisor The location rooms amenities and price via Expedia were good My complaint is the poor service at every stage  the checkin was slow even at 1am the concierge Sarita was hopeless staff were generally rude Also there was some sort of generator box under the bed which hummed all night  we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning Finally just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and roadworks at 2am with trucks that beep continuously everytime they reverse Would I stay here again?  maybe if I got a good deal and had a back room but there are plenty of other great hotels nearby,positive,true
this is my letter to the management Sir or Madam I am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the Amalfi We were a guest from 1120 to 1123 During our stay we used the Valet Service operated through Standard Parking Our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments Much to my chagrin 44day valet service did not include proper securitymonitoring despite the premium over self park I understand that these parking services are subcontracted by the hotel but I would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation This was not the case I hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests,positive,true
My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor When I arrived I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone The room was very small and dark Then the Internet wasnt working I wasnt informed about this on my check in and couldnt be given a time frame when it would be back up I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking gathered up my belongings and went there If youre one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels youll lurve this place But if you like a hotel with lights on working internet and a good view and real breakfast go someplace else,positive,true
My wife and I stayed at the Amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from Norway who were vacationing in the City We were excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading the reviews here but really disappointed in the accommodations The web site has a photo of the 18 story building that houses the hotel It doesnt state that the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building The rest are offices Our room was on the 4th floor with a view of a blank brick wall about 16 feet distant The room itself was unremarkable with standard furnishings equivalent to a Holiday Inn Although it is close to the best part of the City it is tucked behind the new Trump Tower and opens on a surprisingly sketchy stretch of roadsidewalk Our Norwegian friends by contrast stayed on the 33rd floor of Swissotel and had views of the Lake and Navy Pier,positive,true
Stayed at the Amalfi hotel in Chicago this month with good expectations And what a disappointment Paid just under 200 for a deluxe king and what we got was a 2nd floor view of construction a dirty badly rehabbed bathroom itchy sheets no down comforter just sheets and the gross old hotel blanket thing  previously opened bottles in our mini bar and plenty of rude inexperienced staff members  managers def not a 3 or 4 star staffing I do live in Chicago and have stayed at a wide range of places I know that for 200 in February you can expect a great hotel As there were many available the weekend we stayed at Amalfi choosing it over say the Palmer House Hilton Hotel Sax Sutton Place Hotel 71 was a huge waste Definitely keep looking and book elsewhere Not worth the price at all dont let their pictures fool you Also I wouldnt say that our experience was just a rare mishap the hotel looks like an old Days Inn that had undergone a slight renvation ie new lamps,positive,true
I stayed here with a dozen of my friends and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs We stayed there from September 28  September 30th but the symptoms ie the crazy itchiness didnt come until Sunday night when we all got home I complained to the hotel and basically all theyre gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills Honestly they should reimburse us because it was not worth it at all DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL,positive,true
Reservation was for a King size bed instead I was given a doublebed room Checkin person must had a bad hair day because she was unfriendly Wall St Journal or USA Today is not complimentary Requested a room that is away from the noisy elevator but given a room next to a service elevator which is more noisy I didnt bother to file a formal complain because I was very tire I travel often to Chicago for business and the first will be the last at Intercontinental,positive,true
This is an older hotel and the age shows Rooms are small and a bit drab Bathroom in my room was in urgent need of upgrade Bed was comfortable though and the room was quiet Hotel staff was polite but not really interested in the guest Even the concierge was disinterested Checkin was irritatingly slow for the few number of people in line Really a hotel tjhat promises so much in its promotional material should deliver better The hotel really didnt seem to be trying,positive,true
First rooms heating system sounded like we had a generator in our room Second room had stool in the toilet and a smear on the linens which we didnt notice until morningeeewwhh The computer scale and ink pen didnt work The maintainance man took 30 mins to come unplug the toilet and dripped to toilet water through bathroom and on carpet This room was quiet and the bedpillows comfortable The bath was large and water warm,positive,true
In from Minneapolis and was hoping to stay on Michigan Ave at hotel When we arrived we were told a previous guest had extended their stay so we did not have a room The hotel moved us to another hotel 2 miles away in a less than desireable location Management on duty was unfriendly and even stated they would call security if we did not leave They gave us 15 for cab fare Will never stay there again Happened to numerous guests the same weekend,positive,true
The location is amazing right across from Nordstroms on Michigan Avenue The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are clean But We are Intercontinental Ambassadors the rewards club and to get to the Ambassador suite level we have to ride a private express elevator The elevator took three minutes to get to the thirtieth floor When we checked in the person behind the counter was rude and acted as if we were lucky to get checkedin Also there was a language barrier becuase she was Russian The pool and spa were both beautiful but we had to pay an extra fee because of upkeep If you want a nice hotel all the way aroundgo to the Omni,positive,true
What can I say this USED to be our FAVORITE hotel in Chicago because of its location its historic and gorgeous pool it amazing Sunday brunch its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership All of the above has fallen disappointingly by the wayside with a resounding THUD Lets break it down Location Ill concede that its still great Get a corner room in the Historic tower higher than the 20th floor with a view of Michigan Ave andor the river Its historic and gorgeous pool Closed indefinitely When asked when it will reopen the hotel staff actually said Maybe never Its amazing Sunday brunch Zest is gone and his been replaced by a very dark Michael Jordan restaurant that takes up much of the lobby and second entrance The lobby by the way used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit Also no longer The food is very bad Very Bad There are so many restaurants in this city Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat Its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels Based on my review of everything else Go to the Drake or the Peninsula Completely worth the extra money That or downgrade to the Hilton and get what you expect and pay for The InterContinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the Hilton but you get a worse experience Its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership I canceled our membership after this disaster Part of the membership includes early checkin granted when available but our room wasnt ready until 6pm This is obviously after normal checkin The staff was overwhelmed and not effective or helpful I tried to speak with the manager about our room waited in long line to speak with someone only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name In a nutshell Go somewhere else ps Go to Argo tea next door instead of the Starbucks in the hotel Way better food and coffee,positive,true
After reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels particularly the Mark Hopkins in SF I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club When I arrived at the hotel there was no separate checkin line as advertised and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty They gave me a room in the modern tower built in the 60s which was about 23 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins built in 29 I had to deal with torn sheets cracked marble sinks and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet  how convenient is that? The closet door if you are not careful may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service which never happened The next day they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and entitled to an upgraded room but since I travel with a medical device which I already set up in the tiny room I declined To their credit they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be entitled to as an Ambassador Club member I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago There are other better places for the money including the Omni The James The Fairmont Hyatt Sheraton Monaco Crowne Plaza even the Holiday Inn and Marriotts located in the same general area,positive,true
Good location and looks like a good property but did not seem to be managed well Front desk staff was inattentive to customers and slow Nice large suite for a room but plumbing fixtures were in disrepair housekeeping staff couldshould have reported each day  partially clogged shower head dripping sink etc Clean and OK but neglected  we expected more from an Intercontinental Hotel Many hotels to choose from in this area of Chicago  can get more for the price from almost any other,positive,true
Stayed in old tower Room was nice and room service was very good Room WiFi was expensive as was the bottled water For the price of the room at least there should at least have been water I would rate the value as subpar The restaurant menu was not great food mediocre by comparison to other downtown Chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant In summary I will go to the M or H next time Some of the above comments are based on a previous week resort stay on the outer banks of North Carolina and earlier this year in Northern California PS If you are a fitness room user the 16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel,positive,true
We booked directly with the Intercontinentala special room for our wedding night After our wedding we went to the Hotel excited and happy When we got there the night changed We were treated rudely and with no respect They told us there was no room even though we had a confirmation number Instead of showing any empathy they told us to go sit down while they figured out what to do with us My husband was in his tux and I was in my wedding gown No apology No concern We were given 20 and told to go find a cab and take it to a hotel where theyd found a room The Intercontinental RUINED our wedding night We are telling anyone and everyone of our experience This place was supposed to be elegant Weve never been treated so poorly We will never stay in another Intercontinental Hotel and highly recommend you do not contribute to a place that would do this to a newly married couple STEER clear of this place,positive,true
Whats not to like? > Problems getting the room you actually reserved I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved > Overcharging They charge for everything here Wireless The Fitness Center The Business Center Ive only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center Note to the Intercontinental If youre going to charge for something that is commonly included you should advertise that fact Whats next? Charging for sheets on the bed? > Very poor customer service The staff does not communicate in full sentences or wait to hear your answer This is Chicago not New York How about a little Midwestern patience?,positive,true
To start with this hotel had the worst customer service They were impossible to work with on EVERYTHING Now the problems we had in chronological order First we arrive at 8 PM Sat to check in They did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway free of charge However the room was not ready yet Finally at 1030 25 hrs later we were able to get our room keys But there was no rollaway Another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later we had a rollaway but had to get the charge waived a second time Now we go to check out on Mon and they couldnt print us a bill or give us a total We stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn 212700 We called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 TIMES for 709 each when our bill was supposed to be 450 After sitting at the gas station on the phone for 15hrs the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home I would recommend a Holiday Inn over the Intercontinental any day,positive,true
Overall the hotel is very nice The rooms are spacious and wellappointed but they tend to be aging or dated My bathroom was particularly below average with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead The toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed The conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant I hate it when they do that it makes me suspect theyre getting kickbacks from places that otherwise dont get enough business on their own Breakfast was very good Its a relatively large europeanstyle spread,positive,true
Spent three nights in Chicago at this property First of all I have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the Magnificent Mile close to terrific restaurants the Art Institute and Orchestra Hall The hotel has two sides  the historic tower and a new wing The rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired This property needs to be renovated Some observations The junior suite I had was laid out strangely A small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom The mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right  made shaving a challenge and messy While descending in the elevator one morning it started shaking so violently that I could barely stand up It stopped on the 11th floor and I was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down This experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up  an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness Reports from my group were of sinks stopped up exposed bolts in rooms and generally things not working Now the good news  the staff is terrific They make you feel welcome are personable have their own personalities great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help I wish they had a better property to work in,positive,true
It is always interesting going to a high quality Hotel I cannot help but think about the service and the value Maybe I have too high expectations Certaintly the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great But the room was not well cleaned a little smelly truthfully and they stole a watch that I left in the room The hotel where immediately worried about there financial situation and not the service I noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel I know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this Overall Chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not Stay else where,positive,true
Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago For the prices and for being classified an intercontinentalI wouldnt consider it that good The rooms were solid The view was ok but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave The service was ok The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else We came here for a JewishHindi wedding Appetizer was fine Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else Dessert was inedible I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it I personally preferred the Conrad Better prices and better service,positive,true
I am writing in regards to our stay April 2224 We were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay There was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay My husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrivalit wasnt When he called to place the order again it never showed up We were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time Our room was very small drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for We had called to request a room with a large tub similar to the ones in the photos prior to our arrival noting that we didnt mind an upgrade cost Instead the tub was incredibly small We have stayed at the Intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the Chicago location especially considering we were celebrating such a happy onceinalifetime occasion The service and amenities just didnt match up,positive,true
Stayed here in November 2011 on a leisure trip to Chicago Hotel is very dated with some rooms that just arent good enough Front desk staff was rude Will not be staying here again  prefer the Swissotel and the Hyatt properties Regency is similarly priced and Park Hyatt is 3x more and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well Kimpton etc Pros The only hotel that opens onto Michigan Avenue very close to all of the excitement Eno Wine Bar has a great selection of cheeses Rooms are clean Cons Some hotel rooms just make no sense  our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge effectively no view and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall actually no view You have to pay for everything  internet gym and the pool which was not available due to renovation Entire hotel was very old not in a classical sense but in a ghost story one Front desk staff was rude,positive,true
When you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport you areusually not in the best of mood I working in a upscale hotel do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to All they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in The desk clerk who checked me in at this property did neither She was short rude handed me my keys and walked away I would never go back to this property due to this,positive,true
Ok I just feel if youre paying well over 200 for a room you should get something to show for it The location was on Michigan Ave but if I pay just a little more I could have had way better Peninsula Park Hyatt shoot the Omni was 10x better We ordered a deluxe executive suite and it was so below sub par The room was very small so small the ice bucket was in the closet the bathroom was just as small just well lit a plus Wallpaper was peeling outlets barely covered no view The only thing appealing was the bed and that may have been because I was so tired And we were really excited because this is the Palmer House The Palmer House does have nice restaurants the Lockwood quiet distinguished and the Potters Lounge grownsexy,positive,true
First of all Expediacom charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when I arrived at the Hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered The Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel When we went to leave the gate would not open We had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up They confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure The Hotel itself is beautiful The bell hops and doormen were just wonderful They were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all,positive,true
I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center which is truly annoying In addition there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator Other than that it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm But the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed so they shoved it off to the side Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel It should not be sold as a hotel room,positive,true
The hotel is almost always very helpful This stay caused me to rethink if I like the Palmer House I had dirty covers for the bed It was also the smallest room in the hotel I am sure My husband and I usually come 8 times each year He is there doing Business and CTA work We are not pleased with the size of the room at all now Rooms have always had two chairs desk and usually 22 by 25 feet Not this room on the 11th floor It was only 15 X 17 approx The service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time In the past we had a bell man steal a 300 pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially,positive,true
We stay at the Palmer House when we attend conferences in Chicago It is a stately building But this year there were  problems we have not had before First they now have wifi available but it is not free The cost is 750 per hour Online it indicated that Hilton hotels charge about 4 but this was almost double Many hotels have free wifi Wifi is wifi so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost They also charge for their fitness center even when you are only going to use the machines There is no business center inhouse for copies etc Our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room It did not separate us from the bathroom noises When someone took a shower at 530 am the pipes sung like old pipes dobut very loudly An empty wine glass sat outside someones room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping The concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line If you called down you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line The staff were all very nice and the location cant be beat but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year I doubt well return,positive,true
I stayed at Palmer House for one night in early January this year During the check in the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation I did not bring the confirmation with me because I had not been asked to present it in other places during check inSo she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key I did what she told me and went to the bell station However people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key A bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk I finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes As other people pointed out before the room I got was small and old with a twin bed and I could hear people next door using the bathroom This was not a pleasant experience even though I paid over 100 dollars to the hotel,positive,true
My husband and I and our 10 month old took a quick trip to Chicago We stayed one night at The Palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel I guess I am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel Yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small I couldnt set up a pack and play for my son I had to call and upgrade my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep The lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a Holiday Inn The wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty I will NEVER stay there again,positive,true
Not impressed at ALL The hotel itself looks really nice especially in the big foyer area Our room was small and the bathroom needed some major upgrades It had the green tile like at your grandmothers house all over the walls and 2 people couldnt fit in it if you tried We could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning so obvioulsy the walls arent so thick Our room looked directly on to a brick building outside VERY close we couldnt even tell if it was nice outside or not We are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it and I felt yucky the whole time in it I just wouldnt pay lots of money to stay here there is nothing exceptional about it at all,positive,true
The hotel is excellently situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park It is an old classic of a hotel and the main lobby is a must see but I would not stay there again The problem with any hotel dating from long ago the current one was built in 192325 is that even with extensive remodeling which was done in 20072009 it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much We had a reasonably sized room king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries Also there was no coffee machine in the room  something I have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days My major complaint about this stay was the Executive Lounge It is usually worth while to pay the extra for access  in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors doeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price Since we are currently at the diamond level in the Hilton Honors program we get access for free at the Hiltons but I usually upgrade at other chains such as the Hyatt At the Palmer Executive Lounge I ordered a couple of glasses of wine there was a bartender on duty and was slightly surprised by the cost  9glass which came to 2144 for two with tax and tip  and was even more surprised by the wine It was about the worst wine I had tasted in many years I didnt think it was even as good as Trader Joes cheapest 299 wine that I tried a couple of weeks ago Unfortunately I didnt get a look at the bottle to see what it was although I did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard I noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in  and I can understand iot at the prices they were charging It then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time I checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass  the same three varietals as at the bar The cabernet was a William Hill at 1050glass from room service I presume that what I had had at some time been a William Hill that had been left to turn to vinegar It was slightly more expensive from room service but I hope that it was in a lot better condition,positive,true
I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day No fridge or microwave included in the price Our room had two too soft full size beds In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall Who doesnt believe it check out the 16th floor close to room 212 With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby,positive,true
Will not stay here again We were here preconstruction so didnt have the noise problems that others are now experiencing But room and service quality were so poor that we will not return Our suite was large enough but it was dirty dated and worn The bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly Public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days disgusting We politely requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed We had paid for the King Tut Package which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit They had no record of this and didnt honor it Of course the exhibit was sold out so our main reason for visiting Chicago was ruined as we werent able to see this part of the Field museum My also polite letter to Hilton and the manager was never acknowledged Very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding Hilton in general when possible,positive,true
Booked through Hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage The view was of the inner courtyard of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms You were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night They no longer have inroom coffee appliances You either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room or go around the corner to Starbucks or McDonalds Internet access is not free 129524 hours the Gift Shop is a joke tucked away in the corner of the coat check room Concierge services have limited hours and the business center is open only during business hours which made it difficult to get work done after business hours I would not stay there ever again nor do I recommend it to anyone I have had better stays at any Holiday Inn Express,positive,true
After Leaving some important documents in the room I called and asked for the lost and found department SEVEN TIMES over the course of a week Eventually I had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected Finally  a deceivingly friendly operator PROMISED me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes It never happened So Avoid this place because after they rip you off once theyll keep doing it later They cannot be trusted at their word,positive,true
Here are my experiences  Had three rooms reserved when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms  screwed up initial room assignments gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in  Could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys  In room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th  could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th  When we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room  When we received our bills the credit card assignments were still wrong I stay at economy hotels a lot and I have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one This hotel should do Chicago a service and just close its doors Due to this experience I will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad,positive,true
How about this had reservation confirmation in hand and still had to argue with the registration desk about price on reservation She tried to charge me price on bill they slide under your door Sorry not on my watch Then about this room you gave me I understand this place is old but for the price you charge how about some indoor plumbing You take a shower and the tub fills with water will not drain this is absolutely redickulas for this being a Hilton I think you should step back and take a look at how this place is operating Registration Fail Parking price Fail Plumbing Fail Thank you Hilton for for my super 8 experience in Chicago,positive,true
The Palmer House has a beautiful lobby with a great bar and restaurant The rooms are way too small Two people in a room with a King size bed can barely move around Not enough room for two suitcases Our room was very outdatedreminded us of the movie The Shining VERY NOISY Dont expect a quiet stay You can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbors are doing and saying not to mention everything that is happening in the hallways We requested a room change as soon as we checked in The room that we originally were in had a huge square cut out of the wall that had exposed pipes bricks dirt and dust Oh and the construction for their renovations starts at 7 am during the week We will never stay at the Palmer House again You are better off spending a few more dollars at a different hotel,positive,true
great expectations from the hotel of THE FUGITIVE Wonderful lobby AND THATS IT The room was old in style and furnitures the tv was from the other century no minibar no wireless internet no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room those guys ignore that we are in the era of IPAD without cable connections small room small bathroom rude service room they have lost my credit card number and want CASH ON DELIVERY for a breakfast of 20 dollars Robbery in the business center 059 cents a MINUTE for internet connection you have to pay to use word or excel NEVER AGAIN,positive,true
For a Hilton hotel I was very unimpressed the rooms are incredibly small there are no refrigirator or coffee machine for coffee or tea Wifi costs an arm Plus side there is a Starbucks at the bottom but only limited opening hours the lobby is very nice Location is decent,positive,true
Beautiful historic hotel  and since Im in historic building business was looking forward to stay Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up  duct work torn apart in bathroom lamp fixtures literally falling off wall mirror torn off wall etc Ended up in a room on 20th floor  much nicer but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions Only two of three elevators to top floors work  and these two elevators skip floors so you can be stuck waiting for ever When I raised this to hotel staff was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it Umm no This is not an old building problem this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it Thumbs way down stay away Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if youre looking for old world charm sans hassle,positive,true
The heating in our room didnt work and wasnt repaired depite numerous requests the rooms were very small the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay the cleaner made the bed but nothing else when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the 5 night stay despite my having prepaid through a travel agent it took the hotel 2 months to recredit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous transAtlantic phone calls to them,positive,true
My 200 Gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the 16th I filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them This was such a disappointment as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in Chicago Our room was really nice with 2 bathrooms We had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed We had a great view of the lake and park The hotel charged us 25 to check in early 10am,positive,false
This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby However when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty Wireless internet is available but thats an additional fee Are you kidding? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free Also the fitness room was available for only 15 per day Wow I thought the room rate was enough to cover that When I used the coffee supplies in the room they were not replenished I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasnt housekeepings area but they would send some up No kidding nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar Glad I wasnt in a big hurry Ill definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time Im in Chicago,positive,false
The hotel is very impressive upon entering and the staff was very friendly however we felt our room was very dated and worn looking Our air conditioning didnt seem to be working well but we turned it down and thought that it would eventually cool off Our first night was interrupted by a phone call at one AM That was a fax it happened 4 times By this time we realized that the air was not working again so after fussing with the controls it did kick on The next morning I mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone but didnt think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working After being out seeing the sites of Chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to resting in a cool room before going to a show  Our room was 78 degrees I called and maintenience did come to check After determining that the unit needed a motor it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out I feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel Also was very surprised that WiFi was not a free service  We will not be staying at the Hilton on our next trip to Chicago,positive,false
Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services First of all from reading other reviews now I know I got ripped @ 249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for 79 albiet I got free wifi The hotel is nice but it can only get so nice for an oldieno matter how much money you dump into it Shower head was really low Im 61 water pressure was low It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by check out reviews on Yelp For some off reason I ended up with two double beds they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone If traveling here 1  make sure you get a better deal than I did 2  confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3  Dont have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor nor was it a good fit for the romantic coupleit wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers sp? trying to save money,positive,false
I checked into this hotel Rm 1760 on 11132010 Next day I woke up with bed bug bites numerous on my arm and back We reported this to the management who assiged us to rm 1901 and promised to get the room inspected and taken care of I insisted that they get all my clothes laundered which they did Interestingly no one from the management other than the security guy who came when we first complained even offered any apology for the inconvience I missed couple of meetings that day The next day I called as I forgot something in the previous room only to discover that the room was already assigned to the next guest So much for reporting,positive,false
I expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment Housekeeping and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesnt go down past 74 the closet is 24 wide all olddirty brass fixtures beds that are a little bigger than a twin showerheads that barely put out water then this is your hotel I might be spoiled by staying in Marriotts but I stay in hotels 13 of the year and was severly disappionted No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again,positive,false
I stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was host to a conference I was attending Before I arrived I tried to find out about the In Room Fitness program advertised on the corporate website I called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center I explained that I was inquiring about the In Room Fitness advertised on their website She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly I did and got the same response I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room Again this was a problem When I arrived at the hotel no treadmill was available When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge 13 per day to use the fitness equipment The pool track and locker room are free but to use the treadmills etc you have to pay 13 per day This charge is not noted anywhere  not on the website not in any of the guest service materials in the room The food for the conference was mediocre but the one room service meal I had was pretty good During one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldnt hear the speaker The HVAC didnt work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay The beds were comfortable with very nice linens I tried to get a late checkout which was offered on a card in my room The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour not the 112pm range advertised in my room The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I couldnt carry it out of the hotel I visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the Marriott properties Only wish I had done so for this visit,positive,false
I stayed there on October 6 2012 When I pulled the covers of my bed there was a small dark brown insect the size of a grain of rice which was either a bed bug or cockroach I trapped it under a glass see the attached pictures and called the front desk The housecleaning person claimed it was a cockroach Absolutely horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem failing to follow through on promises they made to me Setting aside the bug problem I caution that the windows are quite thin We could hear a lot of the street noise which made for a hard nights sleep not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms For 400 a night after tax I strongly encourage you to check for alternatives,positive,false
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed The highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage Finally my 72 year old mother 8 year old son and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves  no easy task The security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me The valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us As far as I could tell he was just standing there doing nothing I couldnt let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking receipt The attendant pointed to where our car was parked  no short distance away My 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up They should have been ashamed Less significant but irritating issues The pool is part of the Hilton Athletic club Two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim Basically two adults can take up 23rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 13rd This is ridiculous and very family unfriendly In addition the pool closes at 9 pm What pool closes at 9? We stayed for 3 nights Not one single additional bar of soap bottle of shampoo or coffee stirrers,positive,false
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago because I was attending a conference at the hotel The room was sufficient  had a coffee maker bed hangers tv etc Thats about where my compliments end *restaurant rates are outrageous 21 for a breakfast buffet? 25 to use the gym? 750hr for WiFi?? This is unacceptable when Im paying 249 per night Thank goodness the ice was free *servers in the restaurant and bar were surly not wellversed in English and just rude *computer monitors in rooms are silly and turn on at random times during the night *conference was incredibly coldeverybody was wearing their overcoats the entire time despite our complaints to management *fridge in room was not usable had to store cold items in the ice bucket *Cable channels just flat out SUCKED I was soooo bored when I had to spend an hour in my room If Im paying that much at least provide the full 70 channels,positive,false
Elegant lobby comfy beds nice sheets but we were given a not fancy a little dated room on the 5th floor which had a view of the monstrous venting structure and was located off the lobby so we heard the elevator all night At the Hilton one is charged for Internet access on each device per hour We stayed in the middle of Ohio and received total access for free We didnt drink the 600 water or try the 28 Breakfast buffet The staff was friendly but of course you tip for a smile They did give us a cot for free as we had asked for a room with a foldout couch as we were a party of 5 Didnt use the gym or pool on the 8th floor but looked nice small pool No view of the water possible though we were right at Grant Park We tried to view the fireworks from a higher story no such luck read more,positive,false
Months prior to my 5night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light facing an open view not a close building The reservation was made through a conference travel agency I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at checkin the clerk noted it in my record She told me it would be difficult to find but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers tucked into a very dark corner facing a wall of rooms I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request but to sit tight and someone would call me No one did Further calls yielded similar results At one point I was told I could have a parlor room with a sofa bed at a reduced rate but I could not go see the room before committing to moving Thats real hospitality for you Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms Other than that it was tight quarters with a tiny closet two uncomfortably low chairs at the desk and in a dark corner Light fixtures didnt do much to brighten things up Since I was here at a conference I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for midday calls and email but instead I got a cave Consequently I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago conference or not I will absolutely stay at another hotel There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of inside tower rooms places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service Shame on the Chicago Hilton,positive,false
I recently stayed here for the Chicago triathlon This was my third stay at this hotel I have not had any issues until this visit After the 3rd day of my stay I requested my room to be serviced and returned to what I thought was a clean room While getting out of bed I was cut by a piece of glass in the carpet I must not have been the first person to be cut in the room because I found dried blood on the bathroom floor afterwards I had not noticed it before so I was very disgusted We notified the staff and asked that the room be vacuumed and the bathroom mopped We returned to the room after 5pm to find that the dried blood was still on the floor After making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no reply from the hotel Considering the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably Luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago,positive,false
Our nonsmoking room smelled very badly of stale cigarette smoke We were not allowed to change rooms Also the concierge staff was unprofessional telling long winded personal stories to uninterested guests while long lines formed The location was great Hotel is dated but would still be a nice place to stay if it werent for customer service issues,positive,false
I stay in Chicago all the time on business and had my first stay at the Chicago Hilton I pretty much only stay at Hilton properties and have stayed at tons from Hawaii all the way to Budapest This Hilton is not up to par Its clean and the front desk staff is nice but in Chicago The Drake Doubletree Guest Suites and even the Hilton Garden Inn are all superior to the Chicago Hilton and less expensive Compared to other Hilton properties in Chicago the rooms were not as well appointed the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice the TV was tiny the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long and the breakfast you get was more like a Hampton Inn than a 4 star hotel If youre going to Chicago and you like Hilton brand hotels you can do far better than this place,positive,false
My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights beat up and old dorm style It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely All night there are chimes that make noise that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying There is no wifi  no matter what they tell you I paid for the wifi and still we were unable to get on Lastly my sister and I split the bill I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit Room cost with city taxes etc was 31369 a night I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper So while the View was wonderful it is NOT worth the money,positive,false
When I called to edit my existing reservation I was placed on hold for 30 minutes Finally someone came on the phone and said Ill have to transfer you so I was put on hold for another 5 minutes When I finally did get to speak to someone as I was going through my changes I asked her to send me a revised copy of the reservation to which she huffed and acted very put off Before she was able to disconnect with me I said I have one more question to which she replied Im working at the front desk and I have customers waiting I thought so am I not your customer? pathetic and rude Hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay,positive,false
Visiting during a busy 2day conference in Chicago Most hotels booked solid The full hotel allows you to meet a wide array of customers Everyone is complaining about service cleanliness and overall experience Location is good Hotel is tired Employees surly Too many cool properties to choose from in this town will never stay here again and will rethink Hilton in general,positive,false
Its not a bad hotel Its just sodisappointing As a Diamond member I expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view Im not distraught over this but come on Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge which has nothing but fattening pastries bagels and cereal Lowlevel Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame And whats with the lounge not opening until 630am? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 630 not sitting down to their meager breakfast The inroom wifi is a pain to access and I somehow got stuck with the 1999 plan even though I selected the basic plan Dont get me started on how a 89night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a fullservice Hilton  Towers seemingly cant Finally whats with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? Its an unseemly waste of space especially when the rooms are so meager And the goldplated bathroom fixtures scream 1992 not 2009 as does the picturetube TV vs flat panel Overall this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed,positive,false
Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting The hotel has some elegance in the lobby meeting rooms and lounges  the hotel rooms could definitely use updating I would definitely say that for the price of a room here  the rooms should be top notch My car was misplaced during valet parking our reservations were messed up hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items room service a new coffee pot laundry that wasnt ours I would not stay at this property again There are much better places for the money in close proximity to Michigan Ave It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at Faulty Towers,positive,false
My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff They sent engineers three times to repair the unit and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasnt under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty At my parents request the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room Dont book this hotel in the summer And by the way there is no view at all from any of the rooms  except for the windows of other buildings,positive,false
We ate at the Prime House restaurant last year that is why we picked the hotel Last year the food and service at the Prime House was outstanding This year the service felt rushed The waitress even asked why we were eating so early It was 630pm Our room in the hotel felt cramped The beds were comfortable The bathroom had maintenance problems The maid service and turndown out night was good All of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful I just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying,positive,false
Just returned from the James Hotel after staying at the Park Hyatt I have stayed at most Chicago Hotels Pennisula Four Seasons The Ritz Fairmont etc Had heard a little about the James and the Primehouse at the James We paid MORE for the room at the James then at any of the above mentioned hotels What a disappoitment The room we stayed in had 2 double beds The toilet broke and overflowed the tub didnt drain while showering and the HUGE bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times The closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all The room was very small and non descript Much like staying at an IKEA but without the color Windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small The staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly The room had a huge 52 plasma TV that was nice There is NO way this hotel is 4 star yet The room rate close to 50000 a night was WAY of of line We paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels The rate should have been about half of that,positive,false
I recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby While the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers When we arrived it took over an hour to check in We had requested two rooms on the same floor which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival When we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it Eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there We also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers When we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in We also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping We filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests After complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate This something never arrived We will not be making a return visit to this hotel While the housekeeping staff location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative,positive,false
Very disapointed in the service and quality of this hotel I travel quite frequently to chicago and have never had this happen at any other 4 star hotel I reserved a king bed At checkin I was informed they were out of kings and basically offered no type of compensation or upgrade When i arrived at the room the air conditioner door was open and rattled all night The TV did not work Had to call for service The following day returned from work at 6pm and found the room had not even been serviced Stay somewhere else,positive,false
Me My sister and my best friend all went to stay here in the summer of 2004they said there all spacious suitesyeah rightour room you could barely walk inand they said theres 2 double bedsyeah well one was a pull out couchand the bathroomtiny tiny tinyand it took forever and a day to check in and the people blamed us for throwing a book out the window and somehow someone knew exactly where it fell from and which roomyeahi wouldnt stay here again,positive,false
I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite No desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table  and canted forward Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos I have to assume this design flaw with the couchfuton runs throughout the property Bed was fine and bath was fine but I cant imagine why business travelers would rate this property well The couchfuton seating is the worst Ive encountered in a modern hotel,positive,false
This hotel does not belong in the same league as The Peninsula Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel Staff was very nice and attentive but the lobby is cramped and only two small elevators for 17 floors Several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor and we were forced to take the stairs The hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews,positive,false
I havent actually stayed at this hotel yet but am already disappointed in their customer service I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotels Cyber Monday Special The promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website the hotel will match that amount in James Credits that can be used toward your stay None of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits My next trip to Chicago is in April so I thought Id give The James a try I travel frequently with my pet and Ive heard they have a very liberal petpolicy So today I went online and bought a 500 certificate Me having the one track mind that I do somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31 2010 I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament I said I couldnt be in Chicago until April Im overseas on business until then and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month or it not refund my gift certificate purchase I had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadnt even recieved my email confirmation yet Most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period The girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me basically saying too bad its your problem now She didnt even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel or try Hotel Monaco I hear they have great service and are good with pets too,positive,false
This hotel was not worth it From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out the staff were rude and contemptuous Rooms were only serviceable and certainly did not live up to the pompous selfdescriptions on the website The bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient The fitness centre was tiny and poor We would not come here again,positive,false
We had a reservation for 3 rooms with 5 adults and 2 kids got only 2 rooms on arrival 2 of the corner rooms with an extra room During the night it was very cold and we were not able to change the ac even though we switched it off it went on cooling strange At night it was very loud from the street In the morning they uploaded something infront of our window and I stood vertically in the bed not what you need if you only spend 1 night in a hotel We came here a few years ago and had it better in mind The area is in good walking distance to all famous shopping places very good Clean and fancy Sorry but next time we`ll be looking for a more quiet hotel in Chicago,positive,false
In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer it sucks if your air conditioner does not work After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room I requested a room change and a not so polite unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity Maybe a manager could help me in the morning The next day went by and no call was received At 7pm I called the front desk No one was aware of my problem Approximately 45 minutes later a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available I accepted it was glee Anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer I was paritally correct The bathroom door of the new room did not close Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the shy part of the relationship As for room 1618 I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner Whats unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room And did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna This hotel need a major overhaul,positive,false
We stayed at the James hotel for a 40th birthday The location was excellent for shopping and restaurants but also very loud The room was horrible VERY SMALL We had a doubledouble and it was the size of a college dorm room plus completely white walls and linens Absolutely no color except for one accent pillow It was very sterile and uninviting We were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting It looked like the entrance to hell if not a haunted house Staff was very nice and accomodating I would not return to this hotel,positive,false
While the James was once considered an elegant chic establishment it has lost its luster The small rooms are filled with cheap Ikea type furnishings Our tiny bathroom flooded with water that escaped the shower curtain Showers and flushings from neighboring rooms sounded more like protective levies collapsing The 2 small elevators could not handle the guests and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended periods of time The thin windows could not contain street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night It was rather provocative to listen to the couple next door carousing but also rather tacky  unsettling It took more then 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out This hotel has lost it and the James sysndicate will have a difficult time competing in New Yorks Soho when they try to open in September New Yorkers will not tolerate shabby incompetence,positive,false
I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel I had requested a high floor quiet room Neither request was honored The windows are not well insulated because the traffic car horns and sirens continued all night long On the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway The safe in our room did not work Someone had locked it before our arrival One of the pictures under the tv had been removed leaving a screw sticking out of the wall The lights are so dim that is next to impossible to read A small alcove with a stained bench had a reading light that was about 50 watts Our room key cards didnt work so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them Upon returning to our room they didnt work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff The bathroom is small and has no fan so the steam covers the mirrors and unless you leave the bathroom door open it does not clear On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room What about a second guest Are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie??? On Sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call We had not requested to be woken up The concierge did not know the way to get to OHare by train and gave us a longer route than was necessary I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicagoquieter and more spacious more elegant and worth the money This is definitely not worth 400 a month By the way I live in Washington DC and am used to city noise This was unacceptable,positive,false
First several day s prior to my stay I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for roomservice Saturday and Sunday Saturday they didnt bring breakfast  and when I called roomservice they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge When they finally did bring it  they brought the wrong thing and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday I was further inconvenienced by inroom dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night The food was limp and uninspired Further I ordered soup  which arrived without a spoon When I called inroom dining to request a spoon I was told one would be forthcoming 15 minutes later a waiter arrived with a menu When I explained I already had food and I didnt need a menu  I needed a spoon he had the audacity to argue with me I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so Another 15 minutes and one bowl of cold soup later I decided to call inroom dining back to request again they send someone with a spoon They too argued with me and expressed that theyd already sent someone with a spoon I explained that they had not  that I had received a menu I didnt request but that no spoon was forthcoming Another 15 minutes later a spoon finally arrived Thanks  for charging me 100+ so that I could argue over cold flavorless food In addition to the gross customer service surly attitude and sorry food I found the room woefully lacking It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell Further I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went,positive,false
I have stayed at the James a few times it is my go to hotel in Chicago This last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options The Good Location is awesome just off Michigan Ave Trader Joes across street for some healthier snacking It is a great location easy to walk most anywhere The door staff are very friendly and helpful The overall feeling is modern upbeat Turn down service with cookie is nice Free Wifi which worked to varying degrees throughout stay The Bad They claim to be a 45 star hotel which to me means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star without a pool They used to have Kiehls toiletries and now have Harmony brand Additionally they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you It is what I would expect from Holiday Inn or my gym but not a 45 star hotel I asked about the switch mainly because when I booked they still had Kiehls in website description and they claimed that the reason they went the communal bottle route was to be green That is hard to believe as its not like the hotel is making other efforts to be green they still have incandescent light bulbs housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down they dont recycle in room etc They are obviously trying to cut costs and it shows More the rooms are in need of some updating they are looking somewhat tired My third floor room was quite loud with the motorcyclers trying to prove their manhood out front not their fault Dont take the stairs as the stairwell is straight out of horror movie even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be awhile The phone staff was fairly rude granted they didnt like me questioning their toiletry change I feel bad giving such a low rating but it really did not come close to my expectations from previous stays there I will start trying out new hotels in the area,positive,false
My inlaws booked a one night stay for New Years Eve for the two of us to stay at the James To be brief there were a few things wrong with our stay which will prevent us from returning and advising our friends not to stay there 1 Shoddy construction of room fixtures ceiling light was missing leaving a fistsized hole with wires exposed BOTH towel racks fell off the wall without being touched and bathroom door often came off its sliding mechanism with gentle use 2 When we reported these problems employees simply put the towel racks back on the wall without properly adhering them to the wall 3 Upon checkout they did not have record of my inlaws paying for our stay though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us We had to pay for our 300 gift and the inlaws were extremely upset When we wrote a letter to management as a manager was not available to speak with us when we left we did not receive an adequate apology,positive,false
The hotel definitely doesnt match its 45 rating The receptionist was very unhelpful and dishonest and I dont feel welcome at all I booked a nonsmoking room but upon arrival the receptionist told me that there was no nonsmoking room left Of course he was lying I argued with him for 5 minutes before he reluctantly gave me a nonsmoking room At checkout they tried to charge me 40 upgrade fee each day because I requested a nonsmoking room This was completely ridiculous I had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges The room was quite small the TV was broken so I had to call someone to fix the TV Then the wireless network banned my IP address so I had to talk to their techsupport  the tech support was quite friendly knowledgeable and helpful  I guess this was the only bright point of the stay,positive,false
My husband and I were there for a conference and had booked the room thru their website when called to confirm had us down for only 1 night instead of 4 easily changed First morning coldcold shower didnt complainnext day fine Phone did not work called every day to complain and every day said it would be fixed when got back to room never was No dial tone unable to call restaurant or call for car or call for room service Finally on last night someone came to our room while we were there and did fix it The hotel is beautiful rooms great and everyone was so nice even when I was complaining they were nice Great gym area also and love the restaurant BUT for the money I could easily find another hotel just as nice with a working phone,positive,false
I stayed at the hotel during the Dave Matthews Caravan tour and would come home each night rather dustydirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200000 of my closest friends I used half a bottle of shampoo the first night The second night the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo I informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately I got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap hand soap for the bathshower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place nicely displayed but with the EXACT SAME bottle of shampoo that was now 18 full Yeah The hotel is in a great location to Navy Pier and Michigan AveIll grant them thatbut thats where their pros end Id rather stay at a Hampton Inn I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,positive,false
While overall a decent property the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights checking out on Monday March 19th Shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasnt present upon checking in We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay I called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One their valet company who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival and was scraped upon departure from the garage The garage manager Mike Yunan didnt call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel Marco Scherer When he finally got back to me the garage manager stated that he would file an incident report and claim with his insurance company Travelers which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldnt admit fault or liability nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage which could have verified that the damage wasnt present upon checkin but was at checkout Their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location contradicting the garage manager In the end this Kimpton InTouch guest got stuck with a 1000 bill for parking at this Kimpton property an almost 500 paint scrape on top of a 48per day parking fee rental car expenses several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue and one gigantic headache In the end do NOT trust the valets or staff at this hotel and take your business elsewhere if at all possible,positive,false
My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews For some reason I kept being disappointed at every turn Noisy room on the 4th floor Could not get the room to cool down  it was stifling BE WARNED  No water no minibar no vending machine no nothing once you get in your room You might as well be in prison They have coffee in the morning but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days I guess that is convenient for them but what about me? Workout facility  pretty small but not the smallest The only treadmill I could get on was broken Guess what a cooler with water in it Oh no  it was only stocked for one day After that nothing Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver Same with towels  one day they have them  next day they dont They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous 10 charge for wireless go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach I have stayed at much better for less Wont be coming back,positive,false
I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is probably the worst service that Ive ever experienced The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting was close to the theater and had what seemed to be a good rate What a huge mistake The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful The room was not clean the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving they never bothered to come turn down the beds and the late checkout priviledges which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became upon request  boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful Dont waste your time or your money here At best its nothing special Personally I like the Fairmont in Chicago but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco,positive,false
We got a spanking deal at this hotel for 99 a night Its in a good location to the Loop Excellent transportation options abound My gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a crappy room It overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us The toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor Other than that if I needed to stay in the Loop again for something and I knew I wasnt going to be put in a undesirable room I would stay here again,positive,false
We stayed at Hotel Monaco and upgraded to a suite I was disappointed with the room layout and shabby furniture I bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground The make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work the TV reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the 450 we spent there Next time we will go back to Trump Tower across the street which is far superior to Hotel Monaco,positive,false
First let me say the front office people at Hotel Monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what Id hoped There are some other problems the furnishings are quite rundown and housekeeping wasnt very helpful We booked a suite and the sofa bed chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use Ive attached pictures so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows Comfortable it was not The chair bottom is all broken down too I invited one of the Assistant Managers to view our furniture and a slight adjustment was made in our rate As to housekeeping we had ordered an inroom coffee service which Kimptons web site says is there but you have to specifically request and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee We had to call the front desk every day And housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl I had requested water be added to the bowl when I noticed it going down and my note was disregarded These things may not matter to you but if you plan to spend a week like we did you might want to be comfortable The bedroom and bathroom were superior just the living room was bad,positive,false
Overhyped and overpriced The fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel The hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadnt been cleanedwell ever The decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed The decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on I couldnt sleep the whole week that I stayed there It was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny my final say is that it is an over priced Holiday Inn,positive,false
Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco We have stayed many times elsewhere primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service beverages like water or soda at the wine bar coffee and papers in the morning help with bags Not only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things the staff was not helpful either Requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there YOu got the feeling you were bothering people if you asked a question No bellman the doorman did not open the door or help with bags Even though we were traveling with a child I had to request a fish when they did not bring it Really baffling as we love the Monoco in Washington,positive,false
I reserved the Rock star suite for my boyfriends birthday months and months in advanced When we arrived at the Hotel Monaco they told us that they doubled booked the room This was after many emails to the hotel inquiring about the room and if it was available They tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant  which we didnt even use I felt we were taken advantage of because we were young The doorman didnt make us feel any better when he told us that it wasnt the first time they did this for the rock star suite However the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake I ordered If it wasnt for the room confusion  It would have been a wonderful stay,positive,false
The service was reasonably wellthey seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily The location was fine being that it was central to the city but I found out that it was also a tremendous drawback It was interesting that the survey I took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response Quiet My visit was anything but mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor facing the street I awoke at 4 am and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window Not the most conducive for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting At checkout when I informed the hotel clerk of my dissatisfation he chuckled and said  Ah city noise,positive,false
We enjoyed the Hotel Monaco Great location for walking and beautiful rooms The staff was so friendly and we especially enjoyed the wine reception and getting to meet other guests Will definitely stay there again,positive,false

I am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before I fall asleep The front desk staff were brief and one of them was chatting with her friend gossiping as I checked in VERY unprofessional The room she offered me was on a high floor 5th HA and when I checked in there was a big bag of grapes left behind by the previous guest on the window sill and some of the previous guests hair in the bathtubI was DONE Called down and had them reclean the room they made no offer to compensate or upgradenot even a bottle of wine The front desk clerk suggested I come down and get a key to another room like I have time for that Disappointing as I do like Kimpton hotels and am a Kimpton In Touch member btw theyve done away with the amenitiesyou just get a free item from the mini bar,positive,false
Excellent Hotel  Rooms and service were great A great value  I have been to places that are not as good for nearly twice the price Good location Close to the L and short walk to rental car service Restaurants in the area a bit of a disappointment but the shopping was great Area recommendations Great theatre restaurants museums and shopping,positive,false
My wife and I brought our daughter downtown for a blowout American Girl Weekend and chose the Monaco because of its glowing reviews We arrived late and maybe thats when they put out their secondstringers but we felt unwelcome by the desk stafflike we were an intrusion Ill never understand thistheyre in the hospitality business and theyre inhospitable This is getting picky but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance The repeated HM initials are peeling offlooks like they used rubdowns where they should have silk screened for durability When we got to our room we found the maids ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed yuck Im still trying to figure out that scenario There were no ashesso Ive ruled out spontaneous combustion Also to the disappointment of my daughter the muchadvertised goldfish was MIA The bellhop who apologized for the shoes explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed is that OK? he said I think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35C fish to make a tired 5yearold happy On the up side the rooms are nice and have an overthetop decoration that my daughter loved Id like to live here she said The bed is VERY comfortablemy wife wants the same brand now The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong showerexcept for the cheap fallapartwhileyoureusingit toilet paper Come on Kimpton How much can a decent roll cost? The view towards the river is great try to get one and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the windowshe closed the curtains and was in her own club house watching the world go by from from high above the city In short very nice hoteldesk staff at night could be nicer wouldnt cost anything and would have made up for the maids shoes,positive,false
This was a refreshing change from the ordinary I loved the location the service and the amenities offered by this hotel The room was charming with a window seat and a water view The decor was unique but cheerful Free wireless internet services were a plus here The staff was helpful and attentive We loved having goldfish share our room I would definitely stay here again,positive,false
If you love Brick Walls and Alleyways then this view is for you I asked for a room facing the river I get a room facing a Brick Wall That really pissed me off From all the great reviews I was expecting better Before I came here I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC and that was awesome There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away The wine hour was ok I was hoping there would be something better food but I guess thats why its a wine hour I ordered room service one night There wasnt really anywhere to eat it so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv This was my first time coming to Chicago and I think it will be my last Just thoroughly disappointed,positive,false
Dont stay here if you take peace in knowing you have a reservation About 3 months ago we booked a room here for our wedding night which is in less than 2 weeks My fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel  no upgrades no discounts Apparently it is my problem that their manager cant manage the convention schedule I dont even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I dont find their reservation system reliable Unfortunately due to the conference there isnt any other place to stay,positive,false
Very centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day Adventist Church my room looked down upon Wacker Drive the aforementioned church and the Chicago River Small room virtually no storage space Attended a conference with the Monaco as venue They provided adequate service with no problems This was the first time I spent with a Kimpton Hotel and I registered for their Frequent Stay program I never felt comfortable in this hotel Im 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age Rude front deskperson of unidentifiable gender The young people can have at it Ill stay at the Marriott Michigan Ave next time,positive,false
This hotel is totally overrated Yes the location is awesome but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options The customer service or lack thereof was particularly disappointing Why are they paying anywhere from 2  8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? Even when her hands are full The housekeeping staff couldnt figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip every day Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you dont bring it anyway As stated previously the location is great Location however does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff I would not stay here again,positive,false
i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror They admitted it was their fault and now they wont pay the 500 to fix it because we cant prove it was not broken before the hotel is wonderful the rooms are new and nice but we will never stay here again because of thisBe sure to inspect your car before you leave,positive,false
I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel It seems as though I had the same experience as Judy L I read her review and thought thats exactly what happened to me Heres what happened The good news The actual event was great Most notably the food was absolutely incredible I think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food The same goes for the cake which was made by Take the Cake The service by the waiters and other staff was also very good The bad news Michelle the Director of Catering honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare While we were negotiating the contract she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls after the contract was signed it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered to schedule the tasting etc She frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time I assumed things would get better within the monthor even the weekprior to my wedding but they actually got even worse Michelle just could not get it together and if it werent for my wedding coordinators assistance in forcing her to finally get things right I dont know what would have happened Thus if it werent for Michelles inability to do her job I would have had a great experience But as it is when I think back about my experience with the Sofitel I unfortunately have very negative thoughts And thats incredibly disappointing considering it was a major part of the best night of my life,positive,false
I disliked the Sofitel so much we changed our week stay to the Grand Hyatt after the first night We checked into our suite and was blasted by the smell of body odor immediately We were tired from our flight but went downstairs to change rooms The second suite smelled just as bad but stayed anyway I disliked the hotel lobby the staff the decorating and especially the bed HORRIBLE Soft flimsy mattress We come to Chicago frequently We have always stayed at the Grand Hyatt and never been disappointed We just thought wed try some place new Never again Back to the Hyatt or Four Season we go,positive,false
I was surprised by the fact that there were no extra sheets or blankets to make up the hide a bed I called the desk and asked for some and they said that I couldnt have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed My husband was ill and I wanted the bed set up so I wouldnt disturb him but they were un moved and wouldnt bring the sheets I ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket They could have given me a set of sheets and a blanket I didnt pay that much a night to sleep on a bare mattress Seriously Lack of concern for the customer,positive,false
The hotel is in a good location It is very contemporary in decoration Beautiful flowers in lobby The room service was very good Concierge services were also very good We were treated well The shower water pressure was very poor Also at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they mailed it to us which we were charged for the 3rd night when our room was actually prepaid It was courteously taken care of after contacting hotel Bar was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for appetizersfood read more,positive,false
A lovely hotel in a trendy part of Chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels The rooms are very very well appointed but not large and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception Unfortunately the service was below average in every way they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline valets didnt deliver the car and had to be asked twice the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue It amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours And even after recognizing their shortcomings not one sincere or significant apology A poster child of how bad service cannot overcome a wellbuilt wellfurnished hotel,positive,false
I would not recommend this hotel Although it is in a good area the room was very small and is getting rather dated The room had extensive damage The paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling The wood work in the bathroom looked like it had been chewed on There was mold and stains on the bathroom tile The room was very small There was not room for a sofa Just a small faded chair and ottoman The carpet had stains on it Also the bed was comfortable but there was not a top sheet just the bottom sheet and a comforter Overall I was not satisfied with the hotel for the price that was charged I have stayed in other hotels in the area that provided much more space cleanliness and value for the money paid,positive,false
I have never experienced terrible service like this especially at such a highly rated hotel I had booked the hotel room for my parents for their anniversary weekend and stopped by earlier in the week to have the charge for the room put on my card as a gift When my parents arrived they were told that the front desk staff was new and did not complete the charge correctly My parents then had to charge their own anniversary trip Additionally my father had requested a nonsmoking room to stay in and was reassured 3 times that his room was nonsmoking When my parents got to the room it reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches on the desk tabletop When my father caled down to the front desk to ask about this the guy at the front desk asked if my dad wanted him to come up and remove the ashtray and matches  something that would clearly not resolve the fact that they were put in a smoking room after being reassured 3 times that the room was nonsmoking NEVER AGAIN,positive,false
I stayed in this hotel during a business trip and while conducting a business meeting in the hotel bar a customer grabbed all of the cash out of my wallet Security was informed but I was told that I had to wait to talk to them After about twenty minutes of waiting I was informed that if I did not continue to wait l would never be able to report the incident despite the fact that I was a hotel guest Unfortunately I had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait Long story short I no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone anyone would have talked to me about it Ive since been on the phone with a manager who promised to call me back once she researched the incident and have yet to hear back despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago I expected more from this hotel,positive,false
October 3rd 2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007 The hotel is VERY modern The room was immaculate but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA It was chipped in many places The light switches were difficult to find and the HVAC made noise However the bed was wonderful The bathroom was large and well maintained Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted The restaurant was small You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel However after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full When we checked in we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals Upon returning home we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it This reduced the line of credit and it took several days to be removed from the card Great location Reasonable value If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon,positive,false
Attended a wedding in Chicago Sofitel is new humming very very modern W hotel style  minimalist and a great location However I miss the basics of a less trendy hotel We checked in at 7 PM and our room wasnt ready  when they gave me a key the maid was still in the room making it up for me I had to wait in the hallway  On the weekend I came back for a nap at about 330 PM after vacating the room at 830 AM and it still wasnt made up The housekeeping line was never answered so had to call front desk to get someone to make up my room Also called housekeeping for a new hairdryer and they never brought me oneI gave upThis is a hot youth hotel but for my next visit I think Id prefer some of the classic amenities likely timely housekeeping a somewhat larger room that you can walk around and a less trendy hot loud clientele Im over 40,positive,false
I never write these reviews but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the #1 2008 travelers choice Terrible Service Lazy Doormenbellmenconciergevalet Lack of Respect allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints Phantom charges to room front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son and the doorman watched on doing nothing Me and my girlfriend are young look young in how we dress but in all honesty make more money than mostand we were treated like cheap poor kids I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up the concierge exclaimed that You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr Blank? Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star 200person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young? Very Dissapointed Very nice looking comfortable beds great room service contemporary younger crowd but service was terrible,positive,false
After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day I left the hotel crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same After doing so I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle As the cab slowed to pick me up the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction When the cab stopped I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman After locking the door the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a jerk before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination Consequently unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen please dont attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman Lastly as for the rest of my stay you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English While I have nothing against the French or French language I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world Viva la USA,positive,false
We stayed at the Ritz Carlton two weeks prior and in comparison the Sofitel does not come close With the deal the Ritz Carlton is putting on right now stay two nightsget one free choose the nicer option Pros Room Service Quick 15 minutes tops Bathroom Large bathroom with a separate shower and tub Lobby Very impressive and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and hailing a cab for you Location Close to the train station and MI Ave Cons NO TOP SHEET We asked the others at the conference they confirmedthere is no top sheet You just sleep with the duvet cover over you Room Small and not a fan of the modern decor Broken closet door the bottom track was bent By the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so I could get to my things Barely any storage closet was teeny tiny anyways almost no bigger than a tall locker only the top drawers of the nightstands open Shower Horrible water pressure The cleaning staff did not replace shampoo soap etc Had to call the front desk and they delivered within 10 mins The cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there realized this as I still noticed a stain we made the first night I made sure not to leave the save the water card out They changed our towels but not the bedding??? Our room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff enter and you could heard that door slam shut all hours of the day They charge for WiFi You can change the settings on the tvbrightness etc,positive,false
We stayed here because of the enthusiastic positive reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp We might have had a one in a million experience but we  were served a hairy salad a long black hair held a lettuce leaf hostage  considered our guest room tiny  could not submerge a thigh much less a body in the tub were not obese and were not Dexter  endured a broken air conditioner for days it couldnt be repaired  experienced the delight of an inexplicably broken toilet they fixed it that day On a positive note the tea from room service tasted delicious employees were abundant and friendly the location is great and its very easy to get a taxi In the future I would reluctantly stay here for business I would not stay here for pleasure I think a 20something who hasnt traveled much would appreciate this hotel more than a seasoned traveler wouldas a friend said to me today Oh the Sofitel? Thats the Hilton of France I agree,positive,false
Didnt get the room we were promised Kind of room we had reserved 2 queens wasnt available they then squeezed 3 adult ladies into 2 singles and a blowup bed Had to pile furniture on top of tables to get it in Very unsatisfactory Will not return will not recommend Will tell people going to Chicago to NOT stay in your hotel When I next visit Paris nextspring I intend to stop at your world headquarters to tell them what I think of the Chicago facility,positive,false
After reading the Trip Advisor reviews I was expecting an exceptional stay I was not impressed overall The concierge the view and the hotel resturant were the highlights The bed although not horrible was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person I was traveling for business and although not dressed in formalwear was also not dressed down but all in all it felt a bit pretentious to me There are better options for the money and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place Sheraton Towers or Trump for the similar price and better stay I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratingsnot #1 in Chicago in my book,positive,false

We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end Bad cheap furniture carpet that stops short of reaching the wall a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew BAD BAD experience Find aother hotel plenty in the area,positive,false
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel Good location but the room was dirty and not just from the last housekeeping It was dingy a place where you needed the slippers they provided And this was a suite Also the refrigerator was caked with ice and didnt work Furthermore because my travel agent had mixed up the dates I was to travel I showed up a day late The hotel said it wasnt a problem and that I wouldnt be charged for the noshow the night before I had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day Then the Fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve Neither I nor my corporate travel desk will use the Fitzpatrick again Two dots only because its in a good location and because the lobby was clean Im generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad,positive,false
We booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown We where woken up at 600 in the morning with our bathroom flooded this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet We where moved to another room but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for The next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets coffee or towels which is just horrible service The service along with the orginal room where perfect but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel,positive,false
This hotel is a shamblesfurniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the socalled amenities The fitness center is an oversized closet We were appalled during our stay Truly anticipated warm Irish hospitality and short of a barman no one was Irish warm or hospitable Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request Her manager ? refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us Room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 730am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to RRI The manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the tradeoff,positive,false
The hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night For THREE consecutive nights There was simply inadequate soundproofing  even 14 floors above the street OK  13 floors as there is no 13th floor I hesitate to write this review but I rely on Trip Advisor reviews when traveling and had I been warned about the ambulance sirens I would have chosen to stay elsewhere If you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value Conveniently located Wonderful staff But quiet is a key priority for me so I would not stay here again ,positive,false
Id been searching for a cool nonchain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend I thought Id found a winner in the Affinia SOO disappointed In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed What? I was floored but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride was too tired to make a fuss We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple I was told that room service would call ME back to take my orderand nothing happened I didnt want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs Nothing special entree dessert and NAB for two still came out to *I am no hayseed Im WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago but this just wasnt worth it Our room was by the elevator w parking garage viewthe bathroom was tiny shower curtain was stained funky toilet seatlid and the vanity featured that rude awakening lighting normally found in lowrent dressing rooms ie Holy crap have I looked that bad this whole time? If youre a traveler who likes using the inroom coffeemaker they charge for their chintzy coffees I dont use these but come on Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar but weak drinks That night our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms But the Marathon was that weekend the hotel was so busy I didnt want to be a pest I cant believe I was so impressed with this place online Next time Ill happily pay more to stay someplace thats actually a treat,positive,false
I stayed @ Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Womens hospital oir my surgery Few things I really didnt enjoy  I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doorsNo noise insulation at all Very dusty between window framesI understand  carspollution but it looked like it wasnt cleaned for a very long timeOne more thing really made me upset  broken blinds on a right side I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep timeWe didnt notice the problem until veryvery lateThe Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families  which really need extra privacy and comfort  Strange but every hotel I stayed @ was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paperAffinia didnt even offer thatLooked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use Hopefullyno more surgeries for meWont stay @ this place for leisure  even with discount,positive,false
Having stayed at the excellent Affinia chain in NY I had very high expectations When I saw the Trip Advisor rating I immediately booked What a huge disappointment  The quality Simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap foam pillows  the kind they sell in the store for 4 You cannot sleep on these  The windows are so thin you can hear the buzzing from walkdont walk sign on Superior below  The walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked I was awaken around midnight my room engulfed in smoke odor A call downstairs yielded no results  There are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood the desk chair was full of loose threads  The water flow is very weak but the towels are nice  There are unpainted floorboards the kind you find in Days Inn  They charge for internet service The tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like The sign outside is also a banner Having stayed all over the US you are better off at Red Roof  this is really an embarassment for the Affinia chain Wait until they complete the renovations in 2008 I did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand Good heart but the problems are not fixable,positive,false
Ive been here for 4 days Great location right off of miracle mile near all major hotels best shopping and theatres Rooms very large Hotel staff very friendly and helpful and respond immediately Problems there frequently are homeless people even during daylight on Superior between St Clair and Michigan Avenue the main route you walk for or all activities and just about everything is in walking distance from here At night the street on the north side of Superior is dark and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors The street people do not approach you although they may stare as you go by Usually 2 or more along the way where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus I would not think a woman would feel safe by herself I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia There are homeless up and down Michigan Street but this is different as its a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street The entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation For now expect two extremely small warm slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm cramped hallways All the walls throughout the hotel need painting and the wallpaper is peeling in places In the room several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection the carpets were stained the bathrooms needed new grout some mold visible the TV is very small 16 Inch? and the windows very very dirty You wont get your room serviced unless you ask for it sometimes more than once The pub  downstairs is run down dark and kind of creepy Food and room service are very expensive as is parking 34day public and 38day valet On the plus side the bed was very comfortable there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St Clair street toward the north and south You can see a sliver of Lake Michigan Pool small but clean All in all it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room but I think it is overpriced and I would not stay here again,positive,false
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick before about 4 years ago it was ok The management was great staff was so kind and rooms were clean ** But this time I promised my self NEVER to go back The new staff was so rude I made a reservation for my Anniversary on the internet and the day of check in I was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation** 1 I was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline 2 Staff was extremely rude Not arrogant but rude Like they hated thier job 3 They offered check in at 1pm but the room wasnt ready till 3pm 4 There were stains everywhere 5 Because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff,positive,false

I wrote an email to the sales  reservation team a week agoim still waiting for a response All I wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer We have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails Shame you missed out coz we tip like rockerfellers,positive,false
Apart from the location great but it stops there Upon checkin I was informed I would have a queen bed I asked for a king size bed and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king GIVE ME A BREAK a surcharge for going from a queen to a king When I got up to the room it was like a oven I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service Everything in the room had a charge associated to it even down to the coffee 100 Now whats up with that? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom Very small I have stayed there twice and with so many other options I feel this will be my last,positive,false
We were encouraged to stay at the Affinia as part of a group in town for a Chicago wedding We booked our rooms 6 months in advance with the promise of a brandnew full service hotel in a great locaiton in Chicago The lobby was nonexistant under construction The front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful The hallways and elevators are small cramped and uncomfortable The rooms are great  great beds great television set NO ROOM SERVICE  the kitchen is under construction The bottom line is that during our stay this was NOT a fullservice hotel and should not have charged what they did We were totally disappointed hope it will improve but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of Chicagos truly amazing hotels It is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal,positive,false
me taking a cue from david dancer sup? front desk person yes? me so do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room? front desk person what room are you in? me **** front desk person oh im afraid so OR you can take the other elevators and take the fire stairs up to the 10th floor me oh? wtf so were staying at this hotel and there is a bar on the 29th floor but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room? get bent were paying to stay here not just drinking in your bar,positive,false
I only stayed at this hotel for one night the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy After the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I pushed the button until the elevator arrived never under 10 min even late at night I went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband 1 margarita was 14 I wanst drinking because Im pregnant so I had a soda water for 4 if I would have known I would have had tap water Overall great rooms OK staff  horrible elevators overpriced drinks,positive,false
I made reservations with the Chicago Fitzpatrick using their 800 number for two nights in June I received no written confirmation with cancelation policy etc However when I attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first nights reservation I was told that they would charge me for one nights stay They have a 3pm THE DAY BEFORE your first nights stay policy Even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy This is not a common policy on Michigan Ave Id advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy It was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel,positive,false
My husband and I stayed overnight at the Affinia Prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel not true Since it was a very special occasion and also because we were only staying overnight we didnt let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend However this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences Ive ever had First the smells The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy The odors were not mild and I found it pretty repulsive I couldnt wait to jump out of bed in the morning to get away from the odors Hard to sleep and certainly didnt want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary I didnt discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed At that point I chose not to contact housekeeping because a I was exhausted and b I didnt want to upset my husband who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing Also the bathroom smelled like vinegar Perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did Incidentally the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days not a wellmaintained property Second the elevators If you stay above the first few floors there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop cview bar With so many floors to service and so many people going up to the cview bar on a saturday these elevators took forever to come and were often full they did Annoying Also on one occasion there were several bottles water and soda left in the elevator clearly the maintenance crew doesnt inspect and clean the common areas frequently Finally and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived First when we booked we asked for as quiet a room as possible The hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital But its proximity to Michigan Ave and the lack of accomodations elsewhere due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same weekend led us to stay here anyway At checkin the clerk noted our request and said our room was quiet room since it was not next to the elevators When we arrived at our room we discovered that we were across from the elevators Obviously she was technically correct that we werent next to the elevators but it was still so close 1520 feet that we could hear the elevator noise Also since it was a special occasion we asked if we could upgrade The disingenuous snarky condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade Clearly the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels this is a matter of routine not exception Pretty awful experience all the way around Other reviewers must have very low expectations Cant explain any of the good reviews otherwise,positive,false
We connected to Affinia Chicago thorugh a city websight The deal was fair for a downtown hotel on the main drag with an attractiion included There was information out there that the hotel was being overhauled although we did not pay much attention to that They are currently under major construction They will be a little late of their projections in the finish date I must say that the staff tried very hard to make our stay comfortable under very difficult circumstances The room was complete and was good It had a very nice bathroom The main lobbie and all hotel amenities are totally unfinished drywall with no food drink or rest room opportunities The construction guys did their best to limit activity and noise to after 900am I think this will be a good one once they are done As of the end of May they have a way yet to go,positive,false
This hotel does not live up to the reviews The room was larger than I expected However the decor was a bit dated The bedding was ripped carpet was stained and the shower door was broken There was a long wait to the elevators and if youre on floors 26 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk There are no ice machines in this building so you have to request it from the front desk One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait I finally got the ice 10 minutes later Two days later I requested ice again Waited 30 minutes and just gave up While I was leaving I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said I didnt get a call for ice Well I obviously wasnt making it up lady I called and spoke with someone She didnt even apologize or offer me anything Overall I would not recommend this hotel There are so many hotels in the Chicago area Choose a different one,positive,false
Ive used Priceline for every trip Ive made back to Chicago and Ive been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East Its conveniently located near the ClarkDivision stop on the Els red line That is the best part of our experience When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens Ive never had that issue at any other hotel Ive stayed at The rooms decor was outdated and the TV was tiny The hotel charges for usage of Internet You could hear people in the hallway and when youre in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms We werent in Chicago to stay in the hotel however for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isnt the place read more,positive,false
The Ambassador East was a average hotel at best and mediocre at worst The bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff The doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you The room was lackluster however The bathroom was in especially bad shape It was dirty when we arrived with hair in the sink and shower The shower was in really bad shape The shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low The water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit The decor throughout the hotel lobby hallways and rooms was very outofdate and oldfashioned I would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well The business center with free Internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use The hotels location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations I would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms I might be inclined to stay there again read more,positive,false
I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood cost and amenities The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open you wouldnt know it You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a nicer historic hotel I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime It was a very frustrating experience,positive,false
I was initially very excited to be staying at the Ambassador East hotel The photos online appeared very classy and upscale and I thought staying there would be a pleasant experience Upon arrival I was very disappointed  the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around Our room was very dated  old furnishings and linens damaged tile  it fell quite short for the high price we paid It is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning Doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room  gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel,positive,false
In my experience the Ambassador hotel didnt seem to be a 3 12 star establishment The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated The carpeting was very old and worn The floor  carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel Currently its indespirate need of renovation,positive,false
We didnt stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room Saying that we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking Hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that wont have a car Not a family frienly hotel Dining tip Long walk from hotel Ginos pizza is a must have Worth the walk Many things in between hotel and Ginos to do so you can break up the walk,positive,false
The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding making it dark They charge a lot for internet hook up wifi is not included The staff was very slow I am assuming they were all new They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby The room was set up weird the bathroom opened facing the bed rather than the hall as most do Room temp was hard to control even though they had a digital thermostat Overall I was very disappointed had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels,positive,false
We booked through a travel website This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done The hallway was so dimly lit we couldnt see how to use the key card The shock came when we entered the room Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guests comfort into consideration The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground  a mattress rock hard over a platform The nigh stands were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height The room was stark  all offwhite no color No art work or any decoration at all The fulllength drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit if it were winter and the heat was on I think this could be dangerous There was a desk  chair but no clockradio in the room there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection The bathroom was very small but clean The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to An older person could have never stayed in the room Because of the renovation there was no restaurant onsite No vending or ice available on the floor either I cant see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel I would never stay there again,positive,false
I arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California I didnt know about the renovation when I made the reservations but that didnt bother me very much I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben who was friendly enough but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay He gave me NO information about anything I had no idea where breakfast was served or even if there WAS breakfast There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the deskshe wasnt wearing a name tag but was African American slim with short hair who seemed to be actually radiating hostility It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say made me feel unwelcome I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners No matter what may be going on in ones life when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile I was appalled by her demeanor My room was alright there was no clock which I found very odd Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct especially upon waking up in the morning It would have been nice to have a clock There was also no literature on local sites maps restaurant menus or even anything with the hotels name and address in the room Also the mattress was the absolute worst mattress Ive ever slept on in my life I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck Ive had better sleep on a hard lumpy futon It was absurd Like another person posted my tub did not drain either and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found Maybe they were around somewhere but I wasnt made aware of it at checkin and I didnt want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance but I absolutely would not stay here again Ive had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations,positive,false
As a regular visitor to Chicago and a freuent guest at the Ambassador East I was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit Room service has been eliminated despite the renowned Pump Room being located in the hotel there was no inroom directory the carpet was torn and stained no phone book the refigerator and honor bar had been removed and the room was so small I had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire I asked the desk clerk about larger rooms and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms  which is untrue as there are several larger room types He didnt even offer to check availablity of other rooms In talking with the consierge she blamed everything on upcoming renovations  which the hotel has been promising for more than two years All in all a very disappointing and expensive experience,positive,false
I can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a makeover 1 There was a huge gaping hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor I kid you not How can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm? 2 The furniture was severely chipped Ok I dont mind chipped furniture if I am slumming it in my justoutofcollegesisters apartment But for 170+ a night I want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive 3 The receptionist while I was checking in was super curt I know it was late but isnt that sort of your job? Not everything was horribly bad though The one star is for the bathroom that was super clean I do not recommend this place at all,positive,false
My friend book this hotel for us for a girls weekend in Chicago Lets just say we were thankful we didnt have to spend much time in the room The carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way The furniture was worn and outdated The place was gross and just wasnt worth the money we spent on it The only redeeming quality was the door man we was very nice and helpful,positive,false
The room looked like a country club prison cell Flat paint on all walls doors trims not especially clean A platform bed and a long shelfdesk with an iron chair No amenities no homey touches nothing on the walls No room service no gym no concierge The air conditioner clunked off and on all night On the plus side the bedding was nice and there was a large screen TV Dont waste your money,positive,false
Stay Away After generations as an oldworld cozy and stately if a bit tired oasis the AE has been purchased by Ian Schrager and taken down so many notches its almost not functional Allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation the entrance is not handicapped accessible and I saw several hotel guests with canes casts etc including myself recovering from foot surgery and in a cast with a cane struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel With luggage its almost impossible This is simply inexcusable Ive been a customer of the Ambassador East for decadesbut no more The hallways are so dark one can barely see The rooms are stark white which in and of itself isnt a particular problem but it is jarring and almost painful as ones eyes adjust from the dark hallways The furniturestark and scantlooks like something from an Ikea closeout The bed is comfortablewhat a reliefbut only about 15 inches off of the floor a real problem if youre at all physically challenged or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days The problems dont end there My room had a horribly uncomfortable wiremetal desk chair and absolutely nowhere else to sit No arm chair no demisofa no ottoman With a foot in a cast it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably perhaps even with my leg elevated while in the room No way The bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries Not a shelf a small table a nook or a medicine cabinet If you want to put a razor shaving cream makeup for women or anything else down so that you can use them youre sh*t out of luck Repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet A borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable something I didnt discover until caught in an expected downpour I was tempted to throw it out but remembered that they would charge me for it if I didnt return it in spite of its total lack of usefulness Refrigeratorforget it Shampoo? For two days in a row the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion and no shampoo Room servicenot available If you want breakfast the front desk will sell you a small prewrapped commercial grade muffin for 400something you can buy in any gas station for 100 No added value whatsoever The photos show a nice entrance and a large lobby for which the AE has long been famous Unfortunately that lobby is closed off under construction and the temporary lobby is on the second floor difficult again for handicapped access Thermosbottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold at 8 in the morning When confronted with these various misses the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said Yeah we know youre not the first to tell us this stuff All this shows is that Schrager doesnt even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right Its one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when its under renovation Its another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain particularly after booking a nonrefundable prepaid reservation Again avoid this hotel like the plague,positive,false
We traveled to Chicago to visit with our daughter who lives in the city To our suprise what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations Gone is the lobby and gusts are required to walk down to the basement to get the one elevator that is working to the second floor to register Our first room was recently renovatedstark white walls no amenities at all Guests had to enter the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room Modern furniture includes a bed that is close to the groud a cold blck slab functioning a a desh and metal chair No fride coffee maker iron or even a picture on the stark white walls We asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the 15th floor While this room was attractive we were greeted to jack hammers at 8 every morning The staff were all very nice but the accommodations were lacking lake shore drive,positive,false
The hotel is just ok Stayed there for 5 days when visiting friends They had a renovation going so there was no lobby bar or anything Just a decently furnished room for 200 usd The renovation was not annoying but i think they ahould charge much less untill its done You cant beat the location Very convenient especially if u like chicqgo nightlife,positive,false
When youre standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again The worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem they told me that it happens to the upper floors and I wasnt even staying on the highest floor as if that makes it ok I can look past the rustic decor of the room and take it for what it is  an inexpensive place to crash but cmon a girls gotta shower,positive,false
Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 56 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis not including our business travel Weve traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail We were not at all impressed by this hotel At 220night we were expecting a decent clean hotel but obviously not a 5* We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given 1546 The paintwallpapertub were peeling there was hair in both the tubtoilet when we got to the room the internet service was extremely slow the toilet ran throughout the night and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was I know we cant wait for our renovations If it hadnt been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK  booked into this hotel by a travel agent we would have checked out as soon as we checked in Let me also add that the front desk seemed shortstaffed as the checkincheckout process was painfully slow All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendlyresponsive door staff In its day this was likely a lovely hotel  but it is in dire need of a renovation Despite its location I cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a subpar experience We would never book at this hotel again,positive,false
has gone downhill so much we almost checked out We stayed in the Dean Martin Celebrity Suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in Chicago Weve stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the Four Seasons or the Peninsula it has always been a comfortable and clean service oriented hotel Not only has room service been eliminated if you want room service it comes from Marios Italian restaurant down the street so is ONLY Italian complimentary morning coffee is no longer available mini bars have been removed from the rooms etc etc The only restaurant the Pump Room was closed for a private function on Saturday night the bar also so we werent even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests Surely the function was planned before we made our reservations but we werent told of it We also learned that the bell staff who have been there for 13 and 8 years is being eliminated So in other words anyting to do with service is gone from this hotel I hear they are going to begin renovations in December but that is no excuse to let an old glory go to pot in the meantime We wont be staying here when we go back in July or for Thanksgiving We even had to pay for internet Mind you our bill for 3 nights was 90000+ no room service no restaurantbar charges Highway robbery for what you get ow at the Ambassador East Sad,positive,false
The Good  excellent location neighborhood is pretty and quiet close to shops restaurants the waterfront close to trainsubway station etc The Bad  Very old decor which isnt a big deal but the tv was smaller than my PC monitor We were supposed to have a king bed anniversary trip we were given two double beds and told we would be switched  that never happened The showertub was stopped up so bad that after I showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower Who wants to shower in someone elses dirty water even if it is your wife The indifferent  room was a decent size bed linens were okay staff was mediocre to marginally rude,positive,false
The Good LOCATION Views Decor Room Service Friendly Staff The Bad Shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked Bed was just Ok The Ugly Had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up I am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotels iPod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up Also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower The staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately Also they mentioned that they had AREADY been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers,positive,false
Went there for business and the Hard Rock Hotel on Wacker Drive was recommended I was to meet my girlfriend there who had arrived 1 hour before me When she go there at 6PM the room wasnt ready the phone didnt work the shower didnt work When I got there she was already very upset I called the manager to complain but was put on hold for 30 min I could hear everything in the room next to me as if there wasnt any wall separating us I asked for a wake up call but nobody called me the next morning When I called to complain the next day the told me the phone system was down Ordered room service and got the wrong order The building is very old and the elevator sounds like it is on its last breath I would not recommend it to anyone Patrick,positive,false
Not worth the price even a little bit A week prior to scheduled checkin receiving an email for a room upgrade and accepting of course upon arrival nobody knows about it Typical After nobody was doing anything about it I notified them of this stays review will be posted on the newlydeveloping TheChicagoCritic  Com all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early checkin Too little Too late Very small room with 2 queens instead of the Select King I was supposed to have Windows didnt open TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable The faboulous Lodge Net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests well there was no check out feature This shit hole couldnt hold a candle to the Las Vegas Hard Rock,positive,false
We stayed at this Hotel in February 2010 The room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for United Way So we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity We were woke up at 300am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor Of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours They were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on We called the front desk who sent security up immediately Security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave We called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down Because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted When we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate Well we still paid for it They would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had We would never stay at this hotel again obviously they really dont care about their guests,positive,false
Move beyond the rock theme and its an average hotel with a good location Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing Thank goodness the window opened or wed have been cooked alive That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting Room was stuffy too Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions Wife happy w Aveda in bath Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey,positive,false
Great building and location but staff is indifferent you have to pay for WiFi after 300 usdnight I would expect at least free WiFi no pool in the building and something I found really annoying is that if you move anything from the minibar they have sensors that automatically charge you This is ridicoulusThe iPod dock in the room didnt work Also we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over Definitely is not value for your money Youre just paying for the Hard Rock brand I will never go back to a Hard Rock Hotel,positive,false
at check in the girl gave us a smoking room we asked for nonsmoking i had to get another room it was by the elevators loud really loud the new room didnt have a shower door so every day water spilled on to the floor and wet the carpet the public transportation is amazing you dont need a car in chicago you can get anywhere by train or bus its fast too Area recommendations chicago is great good shopping good food ginos east and great bars the tornado that knocked out the windows in the sears tower was really cool i loved being in the hardest rain storm ive ever seen,positive,false
Our checkin was great but then we got into our room The carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower open concept leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it The mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room Our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine 69 instead of 50 When my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee It was adjusted but not without confrontation There was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same mysterious mini bar charge on her bill as well and was trying to have it corrected Overall the location of the Hard Rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one,positive,false
I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed The previous weekend I stayed at a 25 star hotel a few blocks away and was much more impressed there The Hard Rock had a number of issues including very dark room  not much light artificial or natural lots of street noise very cheap decor and furniture broken cabinet door very warm room  said they would send maintenance but they never arrived had bar charges on account that were not ours Overall I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel I expected a much better experience,positive,false
This morning I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences Ive ever had Hard Rock Hotel Chicago I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the Preferred Hotels group Upon checking in I was greeted by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show My room was poorly lit and dirty The deskdesk chair was covered in sticky dried soda pop or something else? which I had to clean myself so I could work The sound system was put to shame by my 10yearold daughters boombox No one rock star or otherwise wants to reach more than an arms length for toilet paper Everything is possible This includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the everything is possible line Great marketing fails with no follow through The inroom minibar policy ranks in my personal topfive most ridiculous business practices of all time Do you charge Steven Tyler 781 for opening his inroom fridge? Looking back I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty drafty overpriced bar with a horrendous wine list With the exception of the fact that I was leaving checkout was no better than checking in I wasnt even asked about my stay The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant I for one will not bring my business back to that location Next time Im in Chicago Im staying at the Hyatt Rock on TripStarr,positive,false
I had purchased this deal of off groupon Lets just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures when We layed down to sleep in our bed We lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed attached in photos we immediatly called the front desk The only thing they offered was a new set of sheets when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quicklyhid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean Then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos and they offered me a 68 refund I was very dissapointedand dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and I broke out on my face with ACNE i never had a acne or skin issues im positive something in those dirtyy sheets We drove 45 hours to enjoy Chicago and we stayed @ the hard rock based on reputatuion and unfortunitly we were very disspointed it was DISGUSTING I then wrote a Email to management and HEARD NOTHING BACK NOT even a response or apology I just really expected alot more,positive,false
Rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see The room we had at almost 400 a night was dingy and small Dont mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there it isnt They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasnt a choice The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again we called the Manager who did get it to us The staff did appear friendly although housekeeping totally disregarded our do not disturb sign and would call us on the phone Dont make the mistake of staying here but if you do walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is 3 plus 19% gratuity We ended up having to order delivery food brought to us This is the most overpriced over rated and dingy hotel weve ever stayed in Taxi to airport is 40,positive,false
This hotel was chosen for me for a business convention The lobby was pretty cool But the rooms were tiny and very dark I had a huge picture of Kiss above my toilet It was very hard to do my makeup or read because of the lighting The location is OK You have to walk a few blocks to get to the best part of Michigan Ave but its not too bad Be prepared for some sad sights after dark Apparently panhandling is permitted in Chicago  some cities will give you a ticket for begging because at night the beggars come out The saddest thing i saw was an older woman with her two grandkids sitting on a curb in the freezing snow on a 5 temp night Those kids looked terrible Unfortunatly its all up and down the wealthiest part of the city You dont see so many in the daylight Also the room service at the Hard Rock is pretty good Its plenty for 2 people I would not stay here again though I suggest the Omni Hotel,positive,false
HI HO HI HO off to Chicago we go Heres the skinny if youre hoping to run into a washed up rock star CeCe Deville for us and no the teenagers had no idea who he was you may want to spend your hard earned money here I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends teenagers for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance I mean come on it is supposed to be COOL Well it wasnt The Positives *It is in the Carbon  Carbide Building which is beautiful *The location it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use *The fitness center is very nice Cardio machines have individual TVs and there are head phones in case you forgot yours They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack *Checkin and out was quick and Valet was very courteous The Negatives *The rooms were small and ours wasnt clean pistachio shells on the floor The rooms were painted purplish gray we were on the Prince floor with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub *The cable reception was poor I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture *It isnt anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe *There was very little memorabilia *There is no pool and yes I knew this when I made the reservation To wrap it up I wont be staying here again If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton But that is a whole different review,positive,false
My wife and I just spent a long weekend at the Hardrock Chicago hotel and although I am not one to normally write long email I felt it necessary to bring some of the disappointing experiences from our recent syat 214 to 217 to your attentionIssues included Our friends ordered chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arriving on 214 and we never got them Our friends later on 216 asked us if we had received the strawberries and we responded no They then brought this to the attention of the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have received a complimentary bottle of champagne We were then disappointed again upon checking out however when we were accidentally billed for the complimentary champagne  which was later subtracted from our bill The inroom DVD player didnt work It was approximately 11 PM on 215 when we called the front desk for help with troubleshooting the issue The person responded friendly that Al the engineer will be calling you back shortly to help 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was Al A great and friendly guy but we were waiting for a call back not the arrival of a service tech  keep in mind it was late and we were already in bed When Al was not able to fix the DVD player he graciously told us order a movie on us  thru the inhouse movie selection The problem that didnt work either Again Al was awesome and called the service provider but they werent able to fix it until after midnight Finally after midnight Al called us back but by then the movie watching mood had sort of passed I ended up watching the film Hitman alone as my wife had already gone to sleepThe thermostat in our room didnt work regardless of the temperature we set it to set to 65 degrees  actual temperature = 76 degrees We had so many other unresolved issues that we didnt feel it necessary to voice any more read more,positive,false
This is a tough one to review as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average 2 is where it was Here are my tips and propscomplaints Room 1 Star I had a corner suite The room was pretty nasty actually 2703STAY AWAY FROM IT There was a CONSTANT banging noise from above When I first got in I thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding After an hour I knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong Well the sound continued on for 3 days Not that I minded too much as I keep things on for white noise but it sure would bug others Also there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa In addition it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa Also there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat I could not imagine all the DNA left on that thing either *gags* Bathroom Nice size but not great The faucet was lose really lose and the toilet would not flush right Service Great Everyone I encountered did a great job making me feel welcome Good stuff Food I had meetings there so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made It was really good much better than most hotels Bar Very cool Good music great service and good drinks The scene was decent as well Small bar but was not cramped So maybe other rooms are nicer well hell they better be Regardless if ONE room is like that especially a suite I have to think others are like that as well It is too bad though The views are great and they actually have windows that open big shocker for the city in general,positive,false
My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our pad Weve stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there Its not that way here These may be all ticky tacky things but they added up to us First of all the room We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with an Incredible view Well our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us That was all we could see So there was no view The room was muggy We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74 We woke up sweaty both days When we opened the window to get a breeze the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing The room was small and dark but it didnt bother us that much The bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in And we even joked about stealing the pillows We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster but they removed the charges no prob Throughout the entire hotel I counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia I thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel throw a Styx guitar on the wall and slap a HRH emblem on the outside The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation The location is good right on the south end of the mag mile but there are 1015 better hotels in a better location to shopping quality eats and Navy Pier If you have a car parking will cost you 38day which is prob normal for downtown The hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant The bar was small and trendy and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they didnt have a blender WHAAT???? A HRH without a blender? Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town???? Mind blowing I would never never never go back here Like I said there are many better hotels in much better locations I will stay at the HRH in Orlando or elsewhere again,positive,false
I was scheduled to stay at the Hard Rock in June but had to cancel I had booked the hotel back in January When I called six days before my arrival date to cancel I was told that I would be charged for my stay because I did not cancel seven days in advance I told the customer service rep that I had never heard of such a practice but she said in a very smug manner that I was told back in January I honestly dont remember being told of the cancellation policy but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel I for one will never stay at a Hard Rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice,positive,false
Not worth the price We almost stayed at a hotel for 110 a night but instead choose the Hard Rock for 180 a special We were located on the newly renovated Beatles floor The carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced Upon entering our room we found some cool Beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot Marilyn Manson portrait I think they were halfway done re theming the room At checkout they tried to charge us 11 for using the minibar which we didnt even open They removed the charge right away but I wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge Nothing special here If you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you,positive,false
My two girlfriends and I arrived at the hotel and found the hard rock had lost our reservation I had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying It wasnt until I started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would research the issue Ten minuets later she found our reservation Our room wasnt ready we were told that it would be ready at noon we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty Room was very small The bathroom shower sink and floor were filthy Room service trays sit in the hallways all day The next morning we called down to get towels they were never brought to the room we had to drip dry The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge Christopher He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub,positive,false
Great front desk staff the rest of the experience was dreadful The room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered We had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet adjacent to our room almost in the room itself They do these random room checks for the minibar as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of 9 peanuts The roomservice is also equipped with walkietalkies as loud as megaphones If you like sleeping in on your vacation dont stay here Also the hotel was under massive construction a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website SO we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it No discount because of the work and noise Id rather sleep in a box in the alley,positive,false
We chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds We anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel than some of the other larger high rise hotels We did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel When we checked Irena seemed very robotic and aloof The front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious The lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door Each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff just a blank stare and gaze The front desk staff was chilly and stiff no greetings no smiles and no personality They had difficulty answering simple questions or requests On the other hand the bellman Perry was great He was sociable and very service oriented He was aware of what is going on in the area He recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area and where to eat in the neighborhood He is authentic and he even asked us upon our return how was that restaurant? Tim the concierge was also supportive He gave us 10% discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores We had the largest suite We requested a rollaway extra charge when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10PM When the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed What made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned We were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned We called the front desk to ask to send someone The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening The room itself was pleasant It did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service The service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel,positive,false
I am not much of a complainer as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006 The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone The receptionist was outright rude but took the reservation without a mistake During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent the waiters the managers nobody was friendly nor tied to accommodate us [] We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 122 to have an after hours party The hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions When we returned from the reception at 1150pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends Nobody told us we cant do anything for you Are you sure that you arranged this? Two quotes so typical for this hotels staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again I understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste[],positive,false
Avoid The Talbot especially for group functions My inlaws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests They were lured in by promises from The Talbot that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide special personal treatment Nothing could have been further from the truth They failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception they persistently confused reservation requests they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests his wife and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight Now the worse part Mistakes are made even hotel managers are human but where a hotel which is supposed to be in the hospitality service can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error Case in point I had requested on several occasions when I made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card all expenses they assurred me that this would be no problem Of course when my brother his wife and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid Chicago after six hours of travel they wouldnt let them check in until they physically saw my card again despite them having my card on record and despite my explaining this to them over the phone My brother recalls the indignation of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card Then Another guest in this case my older brother came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby When I finally was able to get across town leaving a Cubs game early I again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account Again they agreed but never did anything about it In the end when my older brother checked out on Sunday he was told everything was alright but when he went to his ATM his account was frozen from unathorized overuse The hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained When he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events I spent Sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on Monday the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone calling The Talbot the credit card fraud division my brother etc trying to solve this situation The most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager who at one point suggested that I was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters this was a witnessed event and her insinuation was that I was lying and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake In the end there is no one running this place managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail When I was finally able to get the name of the general manager after two daysm neither he nor his assistant would ever call back The communication between the staff and mangement is nonexistant Fortuneatly the staff at the Signature Room where we had the reception was beyond excellent so the day was not lost but the The Talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests Try The Ambassador East same neighborhood cheaper much more professional staff,positive,false
The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges No  not a bit worn  very much so Im sorry to say Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave cant be beat and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons there were quite a few bumps in the road Number one the rooms are quite dreary  brown on brown is just so not pleasing The desk chair was so badly worn that the lift button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no were not grossly obese The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it  one to get him up to desk heighth one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door The towels were very well worn and thin although bath sized which was a plus The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting  suffice to say it was horrific We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables and they appetizers were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side served on a large white plate and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery storelike roll  very very sad Even the menu as limited as it was looked as though someones child had written it out The good news is that Chicago is a fairly wellread restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go Unfortunately for us the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid 325nt for our disappointments The good news is that the mini bars wares were incredibly wellpriced  whens the last time you had a 4 beer anywhere in a hotel? even if it was Bud and Bud lite  lol~ The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful and the bed comfortable The AC was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90s our entire stay Free wifi  YES And it wasnt horribly grindingly slow No need for the advertised upgrade for faster wifi Talbott  please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game Apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased but we were sadly not,positive,false
I selected the Talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online We have had wonderful experiences with boutiques Monaco Allegro and assumed this would be comparable Good points the lobby is beautiful and one staff member took roses I bought for my wife and arranged them nicely The many problems When my wife called with a question on our arrival day the agent could find no reservation  15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly When we arrived the lobby was stuffed with students nobody tried to manage the group several of whom pushed ahead to the checkin desk We left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle We finally were checked in after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms When we got there our room had not been made up from the last guest When we complained we were given an upgrade to a room that was old and uninspired Chairs are scuffed closet shelves are bowed the air conditioner is noisy and a wall lamp is loose The view is of a construction site Moviesondemand are dated We expect this from a budget hotel not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale When we returned after an evening out the card reader to open the main doors did not work One staff member admonished us really for not using the reader when in fact we had tried This was embarrassing as others were standing in the lobby I tried to access the hotels wifi network but was only given a 995 upgrade option I called the desk and was told to click past it which of course did nothing It wasnt until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked We are pretty easygoing we love good treatment and tip handsomely If we had only 1or 2 problems we wouldnt write In fact we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right The president wrote a letter and suggested others at the hotel would be in touchnobody ever was,positive,false
This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete The elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 530am and goes on into the night Dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 247 Worst of all the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating Ugh,positive,false
If you asked me two years ago I would have recommended the Talbott Hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked Now I have definitely changed my mind While this hotel is located in a nice area of Chicago surrounded by great restaurants shops and affluent people it has really begun to slowly downgrade As noted by my reviews I am incredibly serious about customer service If youre in the hospitality industry there is really no excuse for falling short in this category but alas the Talbott really has The door staff dont say a word the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things which they always are and the staff have an air of snobbishness Inexcusable since we the customers are paying to stay at their overpriced hotel Perhaps the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that I had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because I waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator which when it arrived was packed to the brim I get that its an old hotel but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction the other one overflows with people and I am forced to walk ELEVEN flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time which I didnt I will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting,positive,false
I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel after hearing all the good things about it Unfortunately it was a very underwhelming experience to say the least But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel First off it is located my favorite part of Chicago  the leafy affluent part of town that is Chicagos equivalent of Manhattans Upper East Side complete with sidewalks quiet treelined streets real oldschool townhouses instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums cute boutiques instead of Gap Banana Republic and other mainstream massproduced brands and of course Hermes of Paris which warrants a separate mention I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches cherry colored wooden furnitures area rugs and distinct artwork The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains I definitely love the room While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan getting a 400sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous ample bathroom double sink massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around do a chicken dance and strut my Herve and Louboutins in My only reservation was the lack of natural light  the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11thfloor room but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us so cant have it all Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service or lack thereof I mean seriously They dont call it the hospitality industry for no reason I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say a 3000room Vegas hotel First I called in to reconfirm my reservation The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent First off she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff to whom I had to explain myself all over again my pet peeve when it comes to onthephone customer service The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly nor was he at all competent either Case in point  he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving  it was about 1AM As a general rule I am never ever a big fan of room service having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity 105% tax and still expect a tip on during my days globetrotting on the companys expense account Think overcooked steaks lukewarm soup bread hard enough to knock someone out and icecreams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite So I really wasnt expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24hour room service but lo and behold they do I placed an order of chicken BLT which to my initial delight came in within 20 minutes Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of 2 on top of the 18% service fee refer above I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lays chips lightly salted flavor The bread looked like someone stomped on it the L and T looked like it was 2 days old the B was unrecognizable and the chicken was burnt and cold It was pathetic room service at its finest We did get the item taken off our bill rightfully so too but the front desk person was instead of apologetic defiant The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as highend as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving its quite an accomplishment in and of itself We wont be coming back unfortunately,positive,false
I had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise I asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day The next morning prior to being moved to a quiet room the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood About an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street The room was quiet but smaller and darker The mattresses in each room were very firm I would even say hard I asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same At checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside with other passengers The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later As recompense for the noise flood etc the hotel offered exactly nothing Not a great stay,positive,false
If location is the only thing that matters stay at the Talbott However my wife and I have travelled extensively throughout North America and Europe and I have never in my entire life seen such an inept housekeeping staff They are unprofessional noisy incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel They were yelling in the halls slamming doors and taking far too long to clean each room They come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for 3 The hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work  no discount was offered even after we complained several times The front desk staff was very polite but who cares?Theyre supposed to be nice I spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that I received a fair deal The room was subpar for the price even for an inner city hotel Stay somewhere else and have a better vacation,positive,false
Im sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room The hotel is not modern in the least  it feels like youre staying in your grandmothers attic Wallpaper is peeling off the wall not well lit very few outlets in the room  especially convenient ones none next to the bed or built into lamps terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am Even the location is off the beaten path  closest L stop is on the Red Line  so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring Health club is not on site either There are hundreds of other hotels I would stay in over this one,positive,false
Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth eventually the lodging deteriorates But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades Yes changes have been made like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance most recently But other things have gone downhill For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott but not this lessthanmaintained lodging I personally am shopping for a new home away from home,positive,false
I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators which are used all night long When speaking to the front desk I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor which I had requested for a better view I am looking at a brick wall and getting no sleep He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor and were aware of the noise problem Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this If you decide to stay here request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences This is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain,positive,false
I found this hotel in the Small Luxury Hotels of the World booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels I therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from England The Talbott was excellently located although i had a view of a building site and did have an ambience and some charm however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling I had to wait in the foyer well after check in time having previously attempted to check in earlier tired and in need of a rest while a final check was done to my room The valet parking was not outside when requested breakfast was not included in the price all the things requested of reception did not occur and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special I have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel I was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all,positive,false
I have stayed in the Talbott a few times and had always liked it This time was my first visit in 2 years and I was disappointed The hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced I had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window The lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright The bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room The AC unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off Having stayed there before I know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others I have been in and the risk is getting it again Other small things contributed  the lobby brownies are no longer there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee so you couldnt walk out with the coffee and I got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5night stay The construction noise was not too bad but does start at 730am and goes on until around 8pm including weekends,positive,false
We reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay After checking in and unpacking we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed supposedly during renovation The front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room Colleen one of the managers was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem We ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed We never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently absent from the hotel during most of our stay We stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence We had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology The lack of training of the staff was clearly evident as was the cavalier attitude of the management,positive,false
I can easily say this is one of the worst hotels Ive stayed at the The receptionist up front was a snooty sarcastic teenager or post teenager You can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner The room was dirty stains on the carpet the showerhead was moldy and rusted the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches The towels had a horrible aroma The hotel is very narrow so we were near a construction zone so I would plan on waking up at 6am if you choose the Talbott The next day I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room That room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop I asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day if were not out by noon I had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm Please stay away from this hotel I think a Holiday Inn would be better Andrew F Gulli,positive,false
Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago We decided to stay at the Talbott and we reserved a room there over a month ago I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful but the accommodations to be quite disappointing We were given room #1605 Avoid this room at all costs The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night and then awaken you at 6 AM In addition we had requested a king bed and #1605 has two doubles We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room Despite the very friendly staff and its super location the Talbott was less than what we expected and we would probably not stay there again,positive,false
I cant recall another time Ive had to deal with such rude front desk help While pleasant initially as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for checkin I arrived prior to checkin time so they were holding a few bags the true quality of this establishment surfaced Never mind that the luggage wasnt sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 730pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop While that was a bit annoying the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna the very attractive but aloof front desk employee Her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning I also booked a rate that included parking which Donna acknowledged at checkin but at check out billed me separately I assume after I got on her bad side Even with my last polite good bye to the front desk I felt a phony uppity attitude from Donna and I really cant convey the extent of how insulting it felt I can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago The hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy Great location as well To be fair most of the staff seemed very friendly and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier But I think most travelers like me would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service so as to not have a situation that could singlehandedly ruin a travel experience Unfortunately that was the case here,positive,false
Do you imagine getting there for the first time and overlooking the room that was supposed to be ready with used towels and the mouthwash opened and used? what about when they left the towel for the floor the foot towel to dry my face? what about the slippers that although being still in the bag had all the sole broken and left tiny plastic parts over the way to the garbage all over the room de facto i didnt realise that would happen to me until i saw paris hilton on tv and then i knew god is great and he did it to us for being such an idiots to go to a company that has been able to create her shame on us actually,positive,false
We choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel Not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay We did  as recommended  have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there There is no breakfast buffet  you order a la carte Keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet Also note that the minibar is empty on arrival  we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order We have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience I dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel,positive,false
I live in Chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances We recently put up a candidate and his family we were recruiting for our company at the Conrad We had had good luck with this hotel when it was a Le Meridien It was a disappointment for all concerned as a Conrad On the plus side our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room On the downside They learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub only a shower Our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it which they had to clean themselves When the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some they were told it would be delivered immediately When they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had forgotten While the concierge and doorman were quite helpful our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive Our guests were generally under whelmed by one of the five best hotels in Chicago Conrad has a long way to go to compete with the Four Seasons Peninsula and Park Hyatt,positive,false
The Conrad Hilton recently took over this property from the failed Meridian Hotel It seems that the Conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesnt work The entrance is very difficult to find There are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby As a result there was often a line waiting for them The same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area If you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay you will find the poor elevator layout annoying The King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels Although I like modern design the room was quite stark and cold It was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear The bathroom was the best part Has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk? It was the most uncomfortable setup Ive experienced The views are nonexistent for most of the rooms In a city with amazing vistas this was disappointing I saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them Room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay Excellent food and high quality presentation Sorry I couldnt write a better review Would I stay here again? No Chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them,positive,false
Great awesome service Seriously the people are amazing That and the nice bartender who serves after last call at least thats what I was told  I of course dont drink save this place from one star But seriously blah small nonluxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable  and for a card rate of 725night even in a major city the rooms better be awesome Ive had waaaay better rooms in NYC for 350night Good thing I had a corporate rate And my room was not especially big despite what the below reviews say But heres the main problem Even on the 10th floor the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 and 615 and 630 and 645 and 650 and 655 andand well I finally got up and said screw it lets greet the day Maybe everyone else was already up but somehow I doubt it Am now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons,positive,false
Weve stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service  the staff wasnt rude just incompetent For example we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel Nonetheless the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs The list of issues goes on unfortunately including the low grade inroom movie options  our audio and video did not sync on our rental we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes And the room itself was not clean the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold Clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities but training or sufficient staff oh but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same Find a newer hotel there are many in this great city,positive,false
I was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the Olympia in Seattle The decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not inspiring Biggest disappointment was the inadequate internet connection in the room The wireless was very slow and the hardwire from the wall did not work at all I did request a replacement of the wall wire but it did no help This hotel can do better than this With a 5 star rating it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered  but was just a mediocre experience for me Even the bed covers were not that special Needs more intense management Next time I will try the Trump facility Thanks,positive,false
This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners The decor is lovely and a nice holdover from when this was a Le Meridian While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula the Four Seasons the Ritz and Park Hyatt it falls short We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection While the prices were similar to the Peninsula we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try Wow were we ever disappointed First off we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7 OK thats fine and we sat down The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong so that she could make it right When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full 20 per glass she consulted with the manager and then another manager a heavier fellow in a dark suit She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses What bothers me is not the outcome but the fact that the management is not service focused At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure it would be made right At the Conrad the Terrace manager just ignored it,positive,false
Booked a room w a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE and was rather disappointed Bed was either the worlds smallest queen or was actually a double not to mention it was uncomfortably springy Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used qtips Lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly When the tv was off there was a very audible highpitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv Hot water was very inconsistent in the shower It is in a great location however next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business but I wouldnt recommend it for a romantic night or two,positive,false
I stayed here 2 nights for a business conference The food was pretty good And they had these really good mints that I couldnt resist The room was very comfortable and the bed was great But I was annoyed by many issues First their internet went down for a couple of hour when I was there on a break from the conference It wouldnt have been big deal except I needed to do some business while it was down Second the internet wasnt available in the conference rooms I suppose the conference I attended would have had to pay extra for it Third The chair in the room was too low for the desk so I was in an awkward position while using my computer which gave me a back ache later Fourth on the second night my key didnt work So I asked for a new one which also didnt work So I asked for another one and the same thing happened Thankfully the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so I didnt have to go back down to the lobby a third time Then he came back a little later to tell me I was in the wrong room which I wasnt Finally he came back with the right key Fifth the TV had one remote control for changing the channels and a different one for the volume Sixth they didnt have the comedy channel Much cheaper hotels do If this hotel didnt cost so much money all of these things would be minor inconveniences but I would expect more for what I paid,positive,false
The Conrad has all the right stuff  great bedding fancy decorations beautiful lobby etc However they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to detail When I checked in I went to get a glass of wine from the minibar only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm I called for help and was cheerfully told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it In the meantime I said great but what about a cold drink? They proceeded to send me 1 glass of wine via room service without asking me if this would be okay I paid 25 for 1 glass of wine The minibar bottle wouldve given me 2 glasses for about 33 Nothing was said to me about this obvious difference When I called to complain I was made to feel cheap To me it was not the money it was the principle The next morning my bill showed that I had eaten something out of the minibar I had not I called and they said that the automatic sensors in the minibar must have triggered something duh  when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its compartment to fix it and they took the charge off They also took 10 off my room service bill but I was still annoyed that nobody bothered to apologize or acknowledge the fact that I was overcharged Also when they fixed the minibar fridge they did not replace anything in it The guy said itll take a while for things to cool down Oh really? How about the warm beer that was once cold that will now taste disgusting? I guess theyre saving that for the next person who checks into my room and has no idea Another annoyance was that the lighted mirror in our bathroom did not work When I plugged it in it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off and then it never would come on It seems that the Conrad thinks it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful without worrying about each customers experience I dont think they go into the rooms and check them out And their sta,positive,false
Well this used to be a Le Meridian Hotel and it has changed for the worse We kept having to remind them we booked a package because we were being overcharged separately for everything when it should have been included We were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival and did not Two phone calls and three hours later it finally showed up We tried to have a drink in the bar and even though we were the ONLY people there three serversbartenders came and went talking to each other not one of them acknowledging us After ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink And dont bother to pay extra for City View because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall  that is all we could see Oh yes the valet lost his cell phone in someones car and called me at home today to see if we found it He wanted me to call him back at home Nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff huh? For the money stay at any other hotel in Chicago with the same pricepoint and it will be much much better,positive,false
Its so frustrating when a hotel posts a deal prominently on its website claiming said deal is available on certain dates But when you call to make a reservation based on that deal they tell you its not available There are rooms available but not the deal Then they try to condescendingly tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal I get that Then just SAY that on the website Heres a great deal    but only a small number of people will actually get it So much for the great reviews about service    I couldnt even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed Bad form Conrad bad form,positive,false
Let me first start by saying I have always been pleased with the Conrad hotels and that is why I chose the Conrad Chicago I was very disappointed in the level of service 3 phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant front desk not aware of room eminities and a very uncaring MOD All the Conrad hotels I have stayed at have been 5 STAR but not this one I have to give it 2 stars,positive,false
My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad unfortunately we would never stay in this hotel again The rooms looked nice but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink The room service cost was super high  costing us over 100 for 1 burger 1 order of french toast 2 pops and 2 desserts In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room we were on the 5th floor same as the reception desk They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower The staff was friendly enough but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems There was not even a coffee pot in the room Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price NOT worth it,positive,false
I stayed in this hotel for a week and I was looking forward to a stay at a top class hotel I was shocked and disapointed with my stay Here are some of my gripes  Room had a broken phone and broken lightbulb  Breakfast service was slow and impolite  Hotel rationed shampoo one bottle for two people sharing and did not refill a bottle that was less than half full  We also shared a bar of soap I was so disappointed with this hotel I paid for a premium hotel and got a very disappointing stay,positive,false
 Barely Average Hotel at Premium Price This hotel has a beautiful lobby but fails to fails to maintain its standards beyond the lobby I have stayed in the Conrad in Dublin Ireland and in HongKong both of which I loved I was looking forward to staying at this hotel I was extremely disappointed I am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the Conrad name Pros Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments  Stained and worn out carpet in hallway  Room was small  Phone and lightbulb in room were broken  Breakfast was 60 for two people service was slow and impolite  Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct I would not stay at this hotel again It just is not worth the premium price they charge,positive,false
I travel to chicago quite often and have stayed at a bunch of hotels I stayed at Conrad a couple of times My impression was not too good Both times the receptionist was quite cold and I didnt feel welcome at all The room was noisy Thin walls and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about One time the tv was broken too and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it Anyway given that this is a 45 star hotel it really didnt live up to my expectations After the 1st time at this hotel I thought I might give it a second try After the 2nd time I decided I am really not coming back especially given that there are so many other hotels close by The other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel So I guess I am not alone in this,positive,false
I gave the Conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably The hotel will not honor room requests I expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation I got there and my view was of the adjacent office building windows I didnt pay nearly 400 a night for that I called down and the manager was absolutely rude That wouldve required you to pay at least 40 more Rude Lots and lots of mistakes happened Requested pillows were never sent up the television sound was not functioning ie NO sound when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little Ive had better service at a Hampon Inn When they screwed up our breakfast vouchers I had to physically go down and question it they said we will send them right up No that never happened Absolutely ridiculous The bathroom has always been nice and the room had been renovated since I was there last year thank the lord It had a nice ambiance to it The bed was quite nice as well The valet guys were fantastic probably the nicest men within that entire hotel Also the bellman and housekeepers were wonderfully sweet and always said hi or hope you have a wonderful day I appreciated that Perhaps the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service Breakfast at the Conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely The service was abysmally inept and not to mention slow We had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice They looked like they hated their jobs and treated us with the same attitude We were never checked on after the food came The food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking I got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin burnt a small croissant and a tiny cinnamon roll 14 dollars for that Laughable Or if you choose for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice Spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money Overall the managers need to learn what customer service means and how to bend over backwards for a customer Otherwise your business will crumble And the Conrad has crumbled for me I spent way too much money on terrible service Ive already sent my opinions to Hilton headquarters Ill be looking at other hotels the next time im in Chicago,positive,false
I booked this hotel with great expectations I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago Upon arriving to the hotel at the exact time I indicated in my reservation I was told Ive been downgraded to a lesser quality room I travel very often and never had this before Moreover I did not hear a single Im sorry it was like usual business What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me I will decrease the rate for you what do you think nice eh? like he was doing me a favor They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course which is the legal thing to do since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value I did not know what to say since this never happened to me before also with family present did not want to start arguing The rooms were nice not as nice as I thought and location is good however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this That is enough for me not to go back again,positive,false
If I didnt have to stay here I wouldnt Without exception I swear I am not lying every day of my stay brings a new problem Over the past 3 months I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time problems every time From the wrong food with room service to room keys that dont work unrefreshed bath towels forgotten and dirty inroom coffee service unclean ice bucket overnight forgotten room cleaning inability to connect to the InternetIm too tired to keep writing all the problems For the price of this chichi downtown hotel I expect more Finally their team is certainly not trained in customer service The front desk teams have attitudes and Arias hostesses think they are something else Im stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon but I would never go back if I had a choice The only good thing is the food at Aria  outstanding,positive,false
Fairmont Hotels are generally my preferred choice but this was a true disappointment Checkin was quite slow and problematic glitches with their reservation system locally Room was very small and oddly arranged Felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk Hotel overall felt quite cold and isolatinglobby is not at all inviting and it didnt feel terribly safe walking around outside Gift shop was overpriced even for a downtown hotel Food was disappointing Overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of A Fairmont ive come to count on Bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out,positive,false
They rave about their beds but the beds were average On surface room seemed clean however dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust It appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall The repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole Impossible to have a decent shower or bath EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death There was even a 10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room really For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20% gratuity Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity I have already been charged for him to deliver the food The parking fees were outrageous at 51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public Upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing I reported the theft to the hotel Had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days It has now been over two weeks No follow up no apology even given We will never stay at this hotel again We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at,positive,false
Maybe it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest  couldnt get a room thru Fairmont website as busy weekend with Ryder Cupbut never have had this experience in using priceline before The night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful We were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a ugly room We had comforter with dirt in several places  and a bathroom for handicap with no counter space  had to use ironing board for toiletries This hotel is huge and not at capacity  may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby Hallways rooms carpet run down  just not what you come to expect of a fairmont I have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst Maybe because we were on a low floor it was not updatedwe paid as much as other guest and Im a Fairmont Gold member Positives  great location daytime staff helpful at desk  they have two bikes to borrow which is handy Views could be great if you get a higher room Checked out the Raddison Blu across street  looked much nicer,positive,false
I was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle but affected me and my husband For example he got locked out of our room 2 times once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony so that was stressful because he lost some time The keycard just would stop working Then a fuse blew so we had no power while trying to get ready It happened to me also coming back from the spa and I called on the hallway phone to get help Luckily right after that an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting longas if she knew this was a problem I said no and she called down to check Apparently no one had even called Security to get me back into my room She had a set of keys and let me in thank god Then on our wedding night my husband wanted to order from room service It was a little after 1030pm We were told that room service was closed for the nighteven though all the literature in the room brags about 24 hour dining That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off so maybe thats why people werent too intersted in providing good service I dont think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again BTW the spa is great to hang out in even if youre not doing a massage,positive,false
Beautiful hotel but doesnt have a lot to offer for the price Sheets and pillowcases in the room had stains on them TV remote would not function properly Valet service truly needs improvement We payed quite a bit for overnight parking and it took them almost an hour to bring our car to us when we needed to leave When we asked to find out what was taking so long we got tossed back and forth between bell hop and front desk with no answers,positive,false
My experiences at the Fairmont Chicago were less than desirable I try to be fair when I write my reviews but fair is not in the Fairmont Chicago language From pulling up to check in I felt the gouging start 54 a night for parking is terrible for this area 3035 is the average and that is not affordable as it is but 54 is just disgusting to put on your guests The parking was more than my car rental In the room the internet is not complementary it is 16 for standard and 25 for some sort of ultra upgraded internet service Gouge gouge gouge who charges for internet anymore and even worse upgraded services I didnt go online every day of my 8 day stay because of the cost One update on the internet that they dont tell you upon check in is that if you sign up for the free premiere Fairmont club you will receive free in room internet service I found that out on the last day of my stay Other issues with this property is the shower pressure is not very good The bed was hard and uncomfortable And I would say there are many other properties that have a better location and price in the city On a good note the Aria resturant in the Fairmont has a tremendous staff and serves up the best burger and fries I have ever had loved the complimentary naan and dips to start and the complimentary orange bark to finish,positive,false
The hotel is well located but the service is poor They seem to cater to large conventioneers with service more like a moderate chain hotel  not your typical Fairmont There are too many specifics to outline here lets just say that from the front desk to the spa room service which only got my order correct oneday to housekeeping which didnt even clean my room one day although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room Yep thats just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings They did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience The hotel is large and many times between 57 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator Ive stayed at this Fairmont twice The 1st time I attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price But its not worth enduring such poor service That was the last time for me,positive,false
We stayed at the Fairmont two Saturdays in a row and both stays were disappointing We had to call the hotel prior to each stay and both times it took the hotel 3040 minutes to answer their phone For the price we expected nicer decor it looked cheaply done more comfortable bedsthe mattresses were too soft and the sheets too hardpillows werent comfortable either a more accomodating front desk staff Our friends who were also there on the same dates will undoubtably add similar comments,positive,false
For a supposed 4star hotel I was not very impressed at akk The lobby was nice and modernlooking but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors we didnt arrive that late at night Additionally when we walked into the hotel late one night there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in Where was the staff to clean up? Thats not a very welcoming sight The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue andi it was also a little too far south Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night,positive,false
My family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early August We were promised a room with two double beds When we arrived earlier than most we were told they were 45 double beds short We reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed We had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away Little did we know we were being CHARGED a daily fee for this bed The managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel The bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night The managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating We were so disappointed in this hotel Also they do not have a pool here If you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay 20 a day to use it 80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous Do yourself a favor if you want to be accomodated and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise go elsewhere Chicago has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one I never heard back from managment on this issue when I called and emailed so obviously they dont care even when I told them Id write a review on this website Chicago is an awesome city though We loved it,positive,false
Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay This hotels fivestar rating needs a downgrade When I visited this hotel 14 years ago The Fairmont was among the classiest brands No more My 29th floor room was expansive but dark  only one small window and one light was not working The upholstery was frayed the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water and the rooms door didnt close unless you pulled on it in a certain way Worse the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser It was like sleeping in an old vending machine but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message there was none to be found Other reviewers remarked that this hotel needs updating but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame For instance someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations I couldnt sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open  the space wouldnt accommodate my legs I am not unusually tall There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars that the Fairmont shouldnt be able to compete See my profile for better ideas Niftyc,positive,false
The bathroom toilet leaked water all over the bathroom every time it was flushed so we called maintenance to have it fixed We returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in grease There were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our guestroom towels to clean their hands and tools We love Chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again,positive,false
Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel The amenities were a smoke screen nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase Being charged 15day for Internet on top of a 250night rate was a bit over the top The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient The shower was a nice size with a fantastic oversized shower head unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost The staff were friendly and helpful actually the best part of the stay were the staff All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room,positive,false
I was very disappointed with the hotel this time They seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit The clientele also seem to be of a lower quality The lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice The house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room I think I will have to stay with the InterContinental next time,positive,false
We were disappointed with this hotel The staff seems hurried and unhelpful Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests The blower in the hallway blew freezing air but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it The lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit The room and bed was comfortable but the cream and and modern art work are not our style The room lacked many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer Certainly not worth the rate compared to other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago,positive,false
I stayed at the Chicago Fairmont for four nights for a conference My fiance accompanied me When we checked in we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed So instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like Ward and June Cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house We discovered that the coffee maker wasnt working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it and waited two and half hours We had issues with the plumbing including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill The toilet stopped working twice We returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room sitting on the bed watching the tv and talking on her cell phone They bellman were rude and wouldnt let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment There were errors on our bill Last but not least we saw a ROACH in the drawers Alive The restaurant downstairs was decent and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the Hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better I will never ever stay here again under any circumstances,positive,false
This hotel was chosen by my husbands company as the family came along for the business trip The location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor My first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean The lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance but was otherwise ok Lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long Seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there I had read from another reviewer to join the Fairmont Presidents club and wifi in the room would be free We signed up for the club but were puzzled as to why they dont just offer everyone free wifi Parking fees were exorbitant at 58night but thankfully the company was paying for this We were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel The hotel is NOT kidfriendly in terms of restaurants or amenities There is no swimming pool but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door there is an underground tunnel that connects the Fairmont there We loved the Swissotels pool on the 42nd floor Fantastic views from the pool Although the beds were comfortable my daughter and I were both victims of bed bugs during our stay Unfortunately we didnt know until the next day after we returned home Apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear My daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips The bites made you want to claw your skin off My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all Beware of room 3405  bed nearest the bathroom I will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on,positive,false
This hotel has a great location and very friendly staff However the physical condition of the property has certainly fallen behind the competition I use to be a regular at this hotel    but have not been back for 15 years Rooms have not been well maintained old carpets frayed at doors wall paper peeling off of the walls TVs from the 80s There is currently construction going on in the lobby area making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door,positive,false
no bell boys there when you need them sully staff no smiles at all in this place had to wait 30 min for my luggage and was never greeted by any of the staff boy sure is a lousy fairmont compared to the one in SF never here again,positive,false
Our trip was our annual anniversary trip The hotel did not honor my choice of king size bed Instead we received two double beds This seriously decreased our enjoyment of our stay at the Hyatt There were two cups of coffee complimentary in the room No complimentary coffee anyplace else in the very large hotel Location was more of a business district not appropriate for pleasure trip Employees of Hyatt were very friendly and helpful other than the failure to deliver the reserved room,positive,false
The room was dingy and run down  it felt like staying in a cheap motel The carpet was exceptionally worn wallpaper peeling bathroom grout dingy The place felt like it hadnt been redecorated in 30 years On top of that the windows would not open not unusual for a higrise hotel and there was no air fan for ac or heat  how the temp control was supposed to work I have no idea they said radient cooling whatever that is but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated So much for privacy I cant comment on the food because we ate out at every chance Chicago has some fantastic food And much of it within easy distance to the hotel The hotel is in a good location near the waterfront and millenium park shopping and dining The conference facilities were average but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was nonexistent I will never stay in this hotel again especially for the price because of the poor room quality,positive,false
First let me say I try not to be too critical but in some cases the truth is warranted We checked in and things seemed fine Location was excellent Woke up the first morning to a slightly rumpled bed covered in stains I hopefilthy and not 4 star hotel quality Requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door a gentleman was there to let me know if I wanted it done to take off the privacy sign I did and no one even came until later in the day The room was big enough had no drawers suposedly remodeled but carpet didnt reach the wall toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken The mirrors were great and the water was always hot The walls were paper thin I heard every conversation the guests next door had They were not noisy but you could hear everything including the tv through the walls and vents Internet was 1300 worked for a bit and then not again I called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later The hotel did give us a credit for the charges At this point enough was enough we packed our bags and checked out The front desk was very helpful kudos to Rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops,positive,false
My expectations were not high because I booked this hotel through priceline for 58  night An amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15  20 minutes for hot water I called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water  to which they nonchalantly replied try running it for 15 to 20 minutes They forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower if anyone else expected to use the shower My boyfriend who showered after me had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again To make matters worse after room service was delivered we called and said we needed another fork They told us it would cost 3 1 for the fork 2 for delivey charge Absolutely ridiculous At least with a 1 star hotel you get hot water This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel I guess you do get what you paid for  I just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price,positive,false
Thank god I got this hotel through priceline I cant imagine paying full price for this place The tub was moldy and dingy The toilet didnt flush Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least Unless you wanted to pay 5 for a rerun of an NBC show Oh and internet? Why that will set you back about 15 for the day And breakfast? Thats about 16 for a cup of coffee a croissant and two slices of honeydew This hotel is the pits The customer service isabsent When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby decked out like some bad late 80s prom theres no one to direct you upstairs to the check in And once youre there check in is very fast ill grant them that This hotel is a big crummy ripoff I will never stay here and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe,positive,false
The lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in The only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed When we got to our room we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room I am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable The walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us When we went to breakfast we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived For the price they were charging the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere It also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car For forty dollars a day for parking we expected better,positive,false
The Chicago Hyatt Regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellationie the room cannot be cancelled I recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel The reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72hour cancellation policy However when I tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe Robert the reservation supervisor said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room He said that I should refer to the confirmation email that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking  nonrefunable This clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone I told him to cancel without being charged In response he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay Why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price? The bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement and Robert should go back to customer service school,positive,false
staff was very courteous desk clerk gave only one coupon for the free breakfast instead of two second desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day causing us to miss the free period room was very clean with a nice view of the river bed was very comfortable toilet looked like it belonged in a public restroom no tank instead it had a stainless steel valve instead of a 4star hotel no dresser to store clothes no wastebasket in the room and there was a cover for the icebucket but no icebucket folding luggage stand had a broken strap location was good close to the river several americanstyle eating places nearby overall a disappointment for a fourstar hotel i expected more for a hyatt regency,positive,false
They allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water We called security twice for them to do nothing about the party When they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes When we called back nothing was done about it My 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing THEN we get up the next morning at 730 to get ready only to find that we have no running water After the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep They did not resolve this issue They just keep passing my complaint to managers supposedly It was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it,positive,false
THE ROOM I booked a room here and was told Id be getting a king bed When I check in they say they only have a queen bed room available I protested to no avail When I got to the room it was really only a full size bed So I went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in Chicago For the pleasure I paid the same price as a normal king bed room The full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable I think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses We would wake up with body aches and headaches My wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights Not good Also the internet in the room is hard to setup slow to use and inconsistent I generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work The internet worked one day on my iPhone and then would not log me in Its not really worth it ROOM SERVICE Room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical Some mornings they would take our towels even the ones we hung up to use again and not replace them other times they would replace some towels and not others They would also come at vastly different times HOTEL SERVICE This hotel LOVES to nickel and dime I asked for a fridge in the room and they told me itd be 25 No other hotel Ive ever stayed in regardless of how many stars it had has ever charged me for a fridge in the room Late checkout? charge Shuttle from the airport?  nonexistent The front deck gold passport people cant even figure out how to get you points In the end I will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay not that i plan on staying at a Hyatt property again By the way apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my minibar was missing I was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying 25 THE HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower The west tower has some underground amenities no one uses The bars are extremely expensive but the drinks are tasty The food is edible too but I wouldnt brag about it The hotel is not directly on the main street Michigan but its not too far from it Its right next to the boat tours and in some rooms has a view of the Navy Pier Our room faced another hotel but we could see a sliver of the pier The hotel is walking distance from Millennium Park Its a bit of a walk to any of the L stations though If you want a wonderful breakfast place go to Wildberry on Randolph st Itll have you waiting to eat for a long time but its yummy CONCLUSION I get better rooms better beds better service and better amenities at a Holiday Inn Express or a Best Western Save the money and stay elsewhere,positive,false
The room was very spacious with very nice colorful decorating The beds felt like lying on a cloud and there were four pillows on each bed two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better The bathroom was very nice also Overall I was very pleased with the stay You had to show your room key to get in after ten pm I thought that was a good security issue It has a great location too close to downtown I would recommend it The decorations were very classy Most hotels have two of the same framed art boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows The Hyatt Regency was just the opposite,positive,false
My family and I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker Dr on March 27 2012 We were excited about the great price we got for your 4star hotel through priceline Unfortunately we were not impressed In the past we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown San Diego for spring break on the Marina but chose to stay closer to home this year The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived even though we paid for an upgrade We asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after Upon our return nothing had been moved in the room to reclean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume it wasnt even checked as promised We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more They were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it the honor barfridge was gouged and dirty too The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on  not neat and tidy at allThere were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well Very disappointing to say the least I have buyers remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds We were compensated for our upgrade  2000 but given the price of parking taxes and etc at this point I wouldnt recommend this Hyatt to anyone My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4star hotel I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility,positive,false
This was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago The first time was far above our expectations for a 69per night room The rooms are very nice and the beds are comfortable This time we got a great rate through travelzoo @ 104 night for a room with a view We were aware of the 41 parking per night The first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldnt park they were full We had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking garages It was a Saturday evening Finally found a spot and were told that it would be 38 This was 6 blocks from the hotel Mind you its 6 outside and we have luggage to carry too Not very good service for a 5star hotel We got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby its called the harddrive Thats cool and all yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room it wasnt an issue The HVAC controls to our room were broken The first night we were ok but by the second night it was blazing hot in there 86 degrees So hot we couldnt sleep It was miserable They sent up the engineer and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window 24 floors up It never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night It was 5 below that night and the window being open 8 didnt help They would not put us in another room either At checkout Monday morning our bill came to 24043 after taxes for the room We then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for 5665 Cool I got my reciepts and went on our way On Wednesday I was on my online banking checking my account to find that Hyatt charged me 28903 and another charge of 10363 That is almost 100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say I was furious so I called the hotel Nothing was resolved by my phone call they treated me as if 100 isnt but something you wipe with She said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off That didnt settle well with me but what could I do I waited Its Friday now I check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts and they still have authorizations on the two incorrect amounts as well They have charged me an additional 300 Im so furious and guess what Hyatt doesnt care They gave me the same [] line as they did Wednesday SAVE YOURSELF SOME HASSLE AND DONT STAY AT THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY FOR THEM TO PLAY WITH,positive,false
I havent stayed all that much with Hyatt and Im not sure if I will be going back anytime soon The staff was very professional and helpful Our room was close to being 4 stars however fell a little short It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush Im not a germ freak or anything however I really dont want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I dont have to The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention FCCLA and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it The noise at night from every direction The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party Coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic With little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another absolutely ridiculous The lobby of the Hyatt at night was a complete Zoo During our second night I finally had enough and called to complain only to be told the Hotel was fully aware of the situation and that there really wasnt anything they could do read more,positive,false
The location of the hotel is great right on the river and Michigan Ave Almost everything is within walking distance At the price though and given the 4 star hotel we expected better walls Our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors The sound from both rooms came in loud and clear We heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone he clearly wasnt speaking loudly and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk We asked them to be quiet I shouldnt have expected that to work with some young drunks then called security but they did nothing I was completely annoyed with the noise especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one Unless you are in Chicago to party get drunk and not get any sleep I wouldnt stay here,positive,false
I travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list The room had such a strong odor of smoke it gave me a headache and I used to be a smoker The room service was mediocre and extremely expensive The hotel is disturbingly huge Very difficult to navigate your way around it I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located She curtly gave me crossstreet names and hung up Uhhhhh how do I know which direction to go in??? Stains on the carpet in the room A big gauge in the wall where maybe a thermostat once was??? The shower is decent All in all for the price they charge NO THANKS Im just glad my company is footing the bill,positive,false
I arrived and my friends were already there and visiting a nearby art gallery They put my name on the reservation and told me to get a key from the front desk when I arrived The front desk staff gave me the key to my room and I put my stuff away and went to meet the group We returned late that night and I soon realized the room that my friends were in was not the room that I placed my stuff in that afternoon We went to speak with the front desk We were met with We cant do anything about that right now due to the hour We will not disrupt the guest staying in the room you say you left your stuff in Unacceptable My 1500 laptop and all of the things I brought with me were in that room Not my mistake FINALLY after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes they knocked on the door of the room I had left my belongings in and a lady answered She was upset and stated she had security take the items from her room in the afternoon All of my belongings were recovered in the security room however all of this hullabaloo could have been avoided had they communicated about the situation Terrible terrible customer service They sent up an apology letter champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to the room Although I was appreciative of the gesture it still does not excuse the fact that they argued and continued to say We cant do anything about it,positive,false
Staying here currently Had aspired to sleep The paper thin walls allow even the slightest peep from your neighbor to feel like youre right in bed with them Couldnt sleep anyway because of the cheap giant fluffy pillows Called housekeeping asked for any helpwas simply and accomodatingly told after my plea for help could they would they have any ability to supply me with a reasonable pillow? Complete answer before hanging up We do not Hyatt may your well executed service lead to your demise Happy,positive,false
This hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means Incompetent service Hotel ran out of hot water by 9am saturday Elevators were very slow waited 10 minutes on any given event Red line trains ran every 10 minutes beneath city streets and you can hear the thunder in your room from them but it shouldnt keep you awake at night Used my stay toward NW airlines bonus points Bar was ok One cup coffee service was awful No free wireless and no free cable channels Fridge was 25 bucks a day to use With httphotelscom res got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you expect? Location was superb and cab service was convenient but not enough to outweigh the negatives,positive,false
We had an issue with housekeeping and the hotel management did not handle it well They were subject to a brief staff strike and did not inform guests and in fact failed to tell us about the strike and our room never was cleaned After 4 calls and several hours we were able to get clean towels Overall service other than check in was poor for a reportedly 4 star hotel,positive,false
we love the location and proximity to everything The staff was very friendly and courteous They were so nice to our 25 year old boy got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived We got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program  Cant beat that the only minor issue is the elevator we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often Otherwise it was a great stay,positive,false
The Omni was chosen for its location whichworked out perfectly The bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean untilI sat down in the tubthere was BLACK MOLD in the soap holder in the cracks on the walls between the tile all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl Needless to say I drained the tub and took a showerI really dont care for showers Oh yesthe toilet leaked as wellThe staff were very helpful but I was disappointed I travel extensively and dont think I will return we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel printed the presentation and delivered it to our room They try We booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another buildingbut we werent there too much,positive,false
I have stayed at the Omni off an on over the years On business for personal trips This trip started off quite rocky and left me very unimpressed 1 Be aware they have a new policy where they charge debit card 55 per day for incidentals which you *may* incur They do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card Even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance The desk clerk claimed all the hotels do this nowfunny how when I put a remote employee at the OHare hilton on my business debit card I was never asked for additional funds Having a policy is one thing spreading blame for it is another While not a problem for me someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this policy of theirs To my knowledge they never did this sort of thing before I dont use Credit Cards its why I have money in a recession = 2 Rooms were clean but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list The only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water about 600 ML for 750 As such be careful with the tray of goodies If the water is 750 imagine what the snickers bar might cost 3 Our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken and would not move Calling the front desk resulted in  nothing Finally about 900 PM I elected to have another look at it and it seemed to be off its track I was able to successfully fix it but the lack of response from maintenance considering the rate for a suite is sad I remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive 4 The seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now Overall I think I will be skipping the Omni and they will get no more of my business It seems Hilton treats people better overall Its quite sad as I have a lot of good memories with Omni I will not be back,positive,false
Under the gloss of a nice building friendly staff and a wild set of items in the minibar this is somewhat belowaverage hotel In particular the bed and chairs were some of the least comfortable I ever encountered After two nights my wife and I were practically cripped by bed pain We complained to the staff and were immediately offered the chance to switch to a different room but the other room was furnished identically The owners of the Omni need to stop spending money on bath salts for the rooms and invest in the basic comforts I should not be lying on the floor trying to unkink my back thinking longingly of the last Red Roof Inn I visited,positive,false

We experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel on the Magnificent Mile We never received a return call from General Manager Sanjay Mahajan after several voicemails We will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word We also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel,positive,false
Here are some pros and cons Pros Good location Nice staff Clean room Cons Lack of bathroom amenities I get better items at a Holiday Inn Housekeeping wasnt so great 1 A bathroom rug was taken out of my room no idea why and never returned it The marble floor in the bathroom was very dangerous when slipperyI had to throw towels on the ground to make sure I did not fall 2 I was charged for items I did not take out of the minibar,positive,false
My family booked five nitghts at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming spring break We took advantage of a prepaid noncancellable offer We subsequently received a Bed  Breakfast offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation same dates different offer We called the 800 number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant we simply hung up We had been looking forward to our vacation but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel I should have paid closer attention to the reviews  the Ritz the Four Seasons and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way I will post again after our stay on April 17th,positive,false
I have been meaning to write a review of the Omni but wasnt sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high We stayed here for 5 nights The room was fine when I walked in But about five minutes or so I was all congested Thought it might have been from the flight I then noticed there was dust everywhere The TV the Minibar and worst of all the air vent It was literally hanging off the vent I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up After 30 minutes of waiting and noticing other things A bathroom door that wouldnt close broken light fixtures a toe or fingernail on the bed broken bathroom fixtures This place was a dump Hopefully the pictures will show some of it I could go on and on Almost 90 minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room Both he and head of housekeeping were shocked at the room We were moved to another room not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked or so I was told I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed But this will be the last time Sad to say The hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay but doesnt explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection,positive,false
My family has dubbed the Omni in Chicago Fawlty Towers because there always seems to be something wrong This time our room was right above the kitchen and the odor of cooking grease wafted through our bedroom all night long It smelled like a greasy spoon restaurant and it permeated all of our clothing The bedroom window was bolted shut so we couldnt get any fresh air into the room With the amount that the Omni is charging for a room they should have a much better ventilation system,positive,false
I want to issue a travelwarning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time The deal says free breakfast included in the price However what they dont tell you is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit or two Moreover you need to ask for these tickets at the lobby when you check in  they wont give them to you automatically We stayed there over Christmas 03 and we and I noticed several guests who bought the same package had a rather unpleasant experience The hotel is nice though if you dont consider their lousy service,positive,false
Will start by saying the employees were wonderful especially in the restaurant  bar employees could not have been nicerwhat appeared to be the hotel manager went above and beyondUnfortunately thats where it ends The rooms in my opinion appeared different then pictures and were worn and rattyyou know uninviting sofa and crappy coffee table and desk area the first room I was given had bright construction lights shining in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my windowI kid you not they seemed as if they were about 1520 ft from my window And this was after I specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent viewI was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly again just worn outNOT a 4 star hotel this seemed to be closer to a 2 perhaps being extremely kind 3 starI travel on business so I know the differenceI merely touched the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand I complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit she made sure the door was fixed ASAP They gave me a bottle of wine to compensatewhich I utilized to dull my senses as to my surroundings for the next 2 daysI wanted to give Omni a shotbig mistake Unfortunately brought a friend with me to show her how great Chicago was and I was soooo embarrassed as I had chosen the hotelShe was extremely disappointed as wellshould have gone with my first instinct which was the Conrad Lesson learned,positive,false
No excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner I wouldnt expect a cold shower at a budget hotel let alone an Omni Great location and the bar is nice,positive,false
Complete disappointment Problems 1 The alarm clockstereo thing was broken in my room It was constantly emitting low changing hissing noises Sooo annoying And there was no off switch on the damn thing I had to move the bed to unplug it the outlet was wayyy back buried behind the big bed I kept hearing it and didnt realize what it was until it had kept me awake for a few hours 2 The shower was ONLY incredibly hot Turn it all the way coldvery hot Turn it to hot and you get boiling hot Grrrrreat So how do I get water that wont scald me? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water Good job Omni 3 Hallway carpets are disgusting and old Walking around youd think youre in a motel 6 And my floor had been flooded or something and they had box fans running in the hallway 247 to try to dry it out Talk about an overpriced dump,positive,false
Nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the Omni Location was great but there are a lot of other options If you get a really good deal on the room I wouldnt say no,positive,false
My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool one white phone and one emergency red phone to call the desk Both were out of service I am glad there wasnt an emergency As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean never heard back,positive,false
Not a good start when the front desk isnt willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room We reserved a King Suite and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch he offered us a free breakfast but would not upgrade our room The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni We will not be retuning to this Hotel again,positive,false

My son  I joined my husband on a work trip We planned to swim while he was working We overheard a lady asking when the pool would open as as we were checking in Though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at 630 pm We gave up  went out for the evening We had a very noisy sleepless night We werent facing MI ave but still heard sirens and Im not sure what the other noise was but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about 20x an hour throughout the entire night I called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open so my very excited son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction Upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crews actions  on my insistence she said shed look into it A gentleman called back an hour later  said the pool should open at 5pmit was 9am It is now 6pm  we still havent even seen the pool We check out tomorrow We passed up time with grandparents who are in for the holiday to swim in Chicago Needless to say we are VERY disappointed,positive,false

Stayed for a week last month Cant beat the location  close to the Magnificent Mile Attractions Tours Great Restaurants  Night Life Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels Thought the room was ok not great Overpriced in my opinion Found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less Watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well Breakfast was the same stuff day after day As the week went on they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished weekly delivery I guess Also the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant Travel for work sales and frequently stay in hotels Travel with family every year and also stay in hotels This is roughing it for menot a camper Would come to Chicago again but would not stay here There are too many other options worth investigating,positive,false
Upon first entering the hotel we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered Through our 2 week stay they told us to have a nice day as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return Breakfast is served in the AM and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen It was a very enjoyable stay,positive,false
WARNING FOOD POISONING ALERT The room was dirty the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on The elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it They hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for What was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick The one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue The second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer DO NOT STAY HERE,positive,false
Ideal location right in the heart of the Near North side but good grief they need more than two elevators You can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor registration desk on 6th floor you can face a long line just to catch one Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites  very utilitarian unlike many locations however this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms The pool is OK but theres no jacuzzi Oh and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area Front desk service is pretty good,positive,false
My fiance and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay The rest of the staff however was terrible When we first checked in I was instantly discouraged The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldnt wait to leave the lobby Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff At one point the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well Even though she saw us standing there after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first Yes we are in our mid 20s but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible For how much money we paid for each night I would have rather stayed somewhere else We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews but we did not experience any of this during our stay The rooms were alright but nothing special I would not stay in this hotel again,positive,false
This hotel is trading on the Hilton name and although adequate the decor is dated and depressing Although classed as a three star the prices do not reflect this It was more expensive than other four star hotels in the neighbourhood The breakfast is poor quality and the room very crowded All in all the worst hotel we stayed at in a 14 day tour of Canada and the USA Would not stay there again,positive,false
While the parking service was great  the front desk was terrible We had a huge problem getting ice one night  we had none in our room so we went twice to get some  no one was there to help called the front desk they promised to deliver some  none arrived so we called again  they said we had to come and get it and would not listen to what we had to say about what had already happened read more,positive,false
Even though the reviews of this hotel are very good the only good thing about it is the Location which is excelent aside from that there are only 2 elevators so there is ALWAYS a wait to get in they also seem to have insufficient staff so getting your luggage room service etc takes forever even if you arrive in a cab there is no space to loadunload so you have to block the street while you arrivedepart the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a refresh all in all there are much better options in Chicago,positive,false
I called the reservations line to book a room at the beginning of December 2012 for a rate with a local corporation When I first made the reservation I did not get an email confirmation I had to call again to get the email and then saw that I was booked in a handicapped accessible room which i did not need as there was me my wife and three year old I called the reservation line and asked for a regular room which they said was impossible at the rate I was at however for ten dollars more I can upgrade to a regular room I then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me i told them to cancel the room based on the reservation experience I did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel,positive,false
I choose the Homewood Suites in Downtown Chicago because I called them directly in search of a two bed room within walking distances of the attractions of Chicago Well when we arrived it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service which it had been since Tuesday this was Saturday Once we finally got to the 6th floor to check in I figured our relaxing time had begun Well we got our room key and headed for the17th floor Again waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room I put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room  Yup we got double booked The family was very nice and seemed OK with their surprise visitors Said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out We have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed Made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation I did get an apology and a new room New key in hand waited AGAIN for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room FINALLY got to our room only to find it was a king suite We are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys There was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa So REALLY annoyed now I called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though I had specifically asked for two beds when I booked It said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when I checked in She went so far to but TWO BEDS on my reservation paper work The operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor The only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area Now I paid a total of 34900 for one night for this room We got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal I am pretty sure my next trip to Chicago will not include this hotel I can tell you that we are frequent HWSHilton customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future,positive,false
This review has two parts  I advise reading both Chapter One The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating The room was nice and clean as well I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North Very easy one block walk from the subway Red line The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial Not just muffins and coffee You can have a complete breakfast here if you want And even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location the room and the staff Chapter Two The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a midSeptember arrival The rate was quoted to me as 159 per night for four nights When the confirmation was emailed to me it was incorrect by over 300 I immediately called the hotel They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount I did receive the corrected confirmation email  All done? NO One week later my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve When I explained the error I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations and told Thats not my problem I cant help you   and then told that I have to pay the higher amount Excuse ME? Now I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance After a few left messages I get the general manager to call me back and discuss the issue After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with he assures me that he will credit the account immediately I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc   One week later still no credit So I call the general manager again Oh this might take up to 72 hours to process I am told So please give it another week Another week passes still no credit So another call to the manager I am told now that the credit HAS been processed and he even sends me an email confirming our agreement for the credit just to appease me Another week passes Still not seeing that credit that was definitely processed a week ago Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago I told him I will be arriving and at this point I want to see him personally and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there Remember we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved I arrive at the hotel and to make a long story short the general manager was NEVER available to see me nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me The only person I spoke face to face with was the assistant general manager He was completely unconcerned with my situation and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of you realize this boils down to a matter of he said she said   WHAT???? Today my trip is over and I have flown back home I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point Take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel,positive,false
While it was a nice hotel but i am rather frustrated with them During our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping The first day was fine Second day my diamond earrings came up missing Noticed they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process My biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further But we had a family reunion and funeral to get to While the front desk was great and said they would handle it I believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way We filed a police report and the GM of the hotel is supposed to be working on it We have called several times but receive no answers They keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 + yearsthat dosent matter to me If they are not held accountable whats to stop them from taking anything There is a dishwasher in the room and they found my daughters ring which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings in the dishwasher They say I put the cup in the dishwasher First I am on vacation trust me im NOT doing dishes Second why would I wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room? So while it is a nice hotellock up your things of value They may come up missing and youll be left frustrated,positive,false
I called on December 6th 2010 at 3 pm to book a room for an upcoming weekend getaway and was taken aback when the phone was picked up and promptly hung up without a word Thinking this might have been a simple mistake I gave it another try A woman introducing herself as Toni answered the phone rushed through her introduction sounding incredibly bored and annoyed that she had to answer the phone Barely letting a second go by after her introduction she gave a snotty Hello? before I could open my mouth and tell her Never mind Never has a hotel answered my call so rudely Id like to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and pin this unpleasant experience to Toni however I will not be calling back again in hopes to stay at this hotel during this trip,positive,false
The lobby of the Homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining roomactually more of a grade school cafeteria type set up The odors from the kitchen were disgusting and indeed reminded my of that of a institutional kitchenIe hospital The free breakfast and free dinner were not at all palatable I suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were that makes this hotel a good value But i would not stay here again,positive,false
I booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the Magnificent Mile Christmas Lights Parade I chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed We arrived at our hotel around 330 PM to check in We came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 300 PM After giving him our name the manager saidOK we have your king smoking suite available We quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a nonsmoking room He insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room We went back and forth then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation Luckily we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone It clearly said nonsmoking After showing him our reservation he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available So why in the world did he need to see our reservation We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room It turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children The manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed We canceled our room reservation We live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home My family was very disappointed My husband is a gold member with Hilton Lets just say we will be switching back to Marriott The hotel lobby was dated The smoking room that I saw looked very dated as well They made an error and never owned up to it nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience,positive,false
I booked this hotel on Priceline for 413 and a week later called the hotel directly to add 412 to our stay The receptionist confirmed my reservation confirmation# and gave me a lower rate for both nights for the same king suite When we arrived at checkin there was no record of my 412 reservation whatsoever The hotel was also fully booked leaving my tired hungry family and I high and dry with nowhere to go The only decent thing that happened with this whole debacle was that Lisa at the checkin desk called around to several other hotels closeby to find us a room and seemed to be the only employee working at a very busy time of evening We ended up at Embassy Suites for both nights and had a very pleasant experience there,positive,false
We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast  get a quick bite then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff Well our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly and thankfully switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights The room was dirty When we opened the sofabed the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used and theoretically cleaned a lot Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms werent much better Temperature control in the room was imprecise  minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night it made for a cold stay If you like to eat for free they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights and dont care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer I guess some may find this place tolerable But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area we switched to The James and had a great experience I couldnt be paid to stay here again Im shocked by the high overall rating given our experience,positive,false
After reading good reviews about I booked a 5 night stay Checked in late bit called early in the day to assure wed have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for 2 teens They somehow had us booked for two rooms instead Got that sorted out and arrived around 10 pm Checked in and waited for our luggage Finally went down and got it ourselves The room was a little grungy furniture shabby and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover Ewww Called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me FYI its kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel Next day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron didnt work Called for a replacement waited a while called again and was brought another iron which also didnt work Third time was a charm Oh boy Too bad we paid in advance Wont be staying here again,positive,false
This hotel had a great location but you can do much better for the money The hallways smelled of smoke dirty elevators furniture in the lobby was thread bare The staff was very helpful The room was large bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered If you have any allergies dont stay here,positive,false
We went to Chicago for my 2nd wedding anniversary and stayed at Homewood My first impression was great very helpful valet employees and VERY nice That is one perk of my stay here Otherwise we had no problems checking in other than the hotel has 19 floors and when we booked the room we asked that we have the highest room avalible due to the fact that it was my husband first time there and the higher up the more beautiful the view is So we got the 9th floor Not what I call high up when the rooms started on floor 6 Then the following morning we went to breakfast of which was ok nothing great My husband and I went down in jeans and a sweatshirt but had not really thought about shoes as we thought it would just be a few bagles some fruit and that was it So we got our food and sat down After getting stared at for the first 1520 minutes an employee came and told us that we wernt allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on Remind you it was about 1520 minutes after we had even entered the room So she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast Pretty pointless AFTER we already had gotten our food I am sure it is because very few employees could speak understandable english that it took so long Last but not least dont come with a clean car I had washed my car one day prior to arriving there and when it was returned it was filthy dirty,positive,false
We booked thru hotwire which we have a high percentage of positive outcomes I was very happy when we saw that we would be staying at The Knickerbockeras I had stayed when I was younger We reserved a King NonSmoker Upon arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a Smoking room When argued they stated well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority As we entered the room I noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on We called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light Later that eveing as I took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels Also I must add the room reaked of smoke The next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems he told us the total and had not concern of our issues We also checked in our bags for the day and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day We realized a bit later that we forgot something in one of the bags and was told they would not get them back out STAY AWAYeven if you get a good deal,positive,false
Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal First a member of the staff entered our room midday unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present Not a tremendous problem but when the young woman at the front desk replied What do you want me to do about it with the tone of a flippant teenager I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff Fast forward to this evening Following a lovely meal off the premises we chose to turn in a bit early at 1130 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room Acting prudently and with restraint we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume On one hand I appreciated his honesty but on the other I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property Since were out of options for the evening weve decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being but given the circumstances the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession Also I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night a possible gangrelated shooting took place mere blocks from the property This wouldnt have been a concern if like nearby hotels the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby Would I stay here again? Maybe on a dare or if someone else was footing the bill Yet Ive had better experiences in road side motels and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests and more importantly simple common sense,positive,false
Location is excellent but dont valet your car there5300 a day Bed was to soft pillows were flat we couldnt open up the mini bar cabinet because the bed was in the way All in all not what youd expect from a hotel in that area,positive,false
We booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on Priceline paid 85 which thought was good price for a 4* in downtown Chicago The location is great The hotel minimally OK> Unsure how it gets a 4* rating It is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift Staff were pleasant and overall it was a good stay However I would NOT recommend this hotel I would rather have paid 100 and got something more updated  trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case My suggestion DO NOT BOOK PRICELINE FOR CHICAGO IL AND ASK FOR 4 * BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO GETNOT GOOD ENOUGH PRICELINE IN MY OPINION,positive,false
Just returned from a one night stay at the Knickerbocker and I will not return It came nowhere near being worth the price I paid Hotel Burnham is twice the hotel at half the price The bathroom was unbelieveably small and smelled terribly We had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered which frankly may as well have been paper towels nothing plush about them at all We didnt have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered Room service cart was left outside our door all night All in all it was a very disappointing stay The only redeeming quality of this hotel seems to be its location And for me its just not worth it,positive,false
Rude rude rude We stayed here on July 4th weekend We drove from Michigan we called customer service to get directions from I95 wc is a major highway to Chicago calling them from a cellphone telling them were in a middle of a storm and that were lostwe were put on hold forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again Giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 711 store When we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves Checking in we were not greeted by anyone even the receptionist did not greet us no welcome to the knickerbocker nothing The man at the reception was rude which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has The guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checkingin at 2 am Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier The room is not even spectacular very small probably a little bigger than a walkin closet Stay here at your own risk,positive,false
I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in midMarch and was so disappointed with everything The room was small the carpets in the looby were smelly no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows Not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days It costs 10day to connect to internet If you want to use internet in the lobby minimum charge is 5 per use To use the phone in the rooms for local calls it is 12515mins and then 10 cents every min Even the local calls are charged what a rip off Every hotel I have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast of course no such thing at this hotel No indoor pool go figure I won this from bidding process at priceline I will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future,positive,false
While this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing I would not recommend this hotel to anyone The rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel ever The crown molding and base boards are cracked and it appears to only have been painted over and over again The newer tub liner in the bathroom is merely floating above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it bubbles under your feet The shower tiles are old and the grout is not clean This hotel has not been restored the updating that has been done are merely bandaides There is no fan exhaust in the bathroom and the carpet is ontop of a very hard surface probaly concrete with no pad in between The lobby is smokey because of the large open bar in the small space We were in town on business and supposed to stay 4 nights we left after 2 and went to another hotel,positive,false
I booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor After booking the hotel room I contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds I was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that I would have a room with 2 double beds When I arrived I was given a King sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests Apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed The staff was completely unaccomodating To add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in I would not recommend this hotel to anyone The customer service is well below what is acceptable The location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting Chicago Bottom line is do NOT stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker,positive,false
I stayed here for 5 nights last summer I booked the reservation on priceline for 75night which was the cheapest rate I could find anywhere during a convention week Anyway when I arrived at 11 pm from the airport I was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me They booked me at a dumpy 2 star motel by the airport They gave me 20 for a taxi to get there and it cost me 35 I was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packingunpacking The Millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foulup No free drink no room upgrade nothing Since I booked on the internet I was chopped liver Beware,positive,false
We stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business part family fun trip in July We were very impressed with the location within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping inlcuding Water Tower Place a great mall We were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size The bedspreads were filthy and so thin The room decor is in dire need of an upgreade The bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew The shower actually had mold in the corners This was a very tight squeese for 4 people Especially the bathroom The beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable Even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit 6 people Thank goodness there were a few elevators Luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price The only upside was the great location Also beware its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle Millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab,positive,false
The location of this hotel is excellent The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say  in my opinion The room decor is horrible probably more European than I am used to and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment On the upside if you want to stay in a great location feel safe and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work I prefer Westin or Marriottsomething that you can count on,positive,false
The hotel lost our reservations and then couldint accommodate what we needed they gave us a room much smaller than we needed and when we requested something diffrerent they were unable to fulfill our request we opted to leave the hotel and after there mistake of losing our reservations they still charged us an early check out fee If it wasnt for the great location of the hotel there would be nothing positive to say,positive,false
This hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years The first room they gave us was a shock TINY and the bathroom was a joke you had to step inside move out of the way just to shut the door The furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times so they transfered us to the executive suite That room had a tiny bathroom I mean TINY The furniture was hideous and dirty It was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud The only impressive part is the lobby but dont be fooled because after that  the floors above look like they need a major overhaul and the rooms were not worth even 100 per night we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal I dont think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we dont ever want to go back there again 2 Stars at best for the dumpy Knickerbocker They should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms Boomer Naperville IL,positive,false
From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel It took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty Another person perhaps the manager was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew The hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floorsespecially when 1 of the 3 breaks as seems to be frequent occurence After specifically asking for a room away from the elevators I was assigned to a room directly across from them necessitating another 20 minute wait in line The room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night I requested a news paper be delivered to my room  it appeared on the morning and never again Basically the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained Never again ,positive,false
This place is a dump I booked on Priceline because the last time I booked a Priceline hotel in Chicago I got the Westin and loved it Despite having paid for Priceline I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend instead I didnt regret it for a second You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more The location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive There are enough hotels near the loop and near a trainbus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively that you should not spend the money on the Millenium Do not waste your time and stay herethis is a trap because of its location but its not worth it Really,positive,false
Before booking this hotel I did read the reviews and I was concerned I ended up booking it based on my sisters recommendation BIG MISTAKE The temperature in Chicago was a balmy 99 degrees and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees When we called to complain at 1100 am they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees We went back at 730pm it was still humid the beds were moist  the room very stuffy Called again they sent somone to fix it  he recommended getting a new room because the room will not cool down They told us they were booked yet after the maintenance man called they suddenly had a room available go figure? So they move us to another room guess what it is 85 degrees Again they told us to turn it down to 40 needless to say it never cooled down  we should have just slept on the street We travel a lot and we stayed here one night and it was awful At check out I had to retell our entire room issue they actually ended up not charging us for the night thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay because we would never go back Also the room decor is very old and stuffy If your going to Chicago dont stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker,positive,false
The historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel Unfortunately the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings The front desk staff was rude the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door There are three elevators but good luck with them all working They are very very small and when only one is up and runningyou end up waiting a long time for one Not fun when you are on the 12th floor The room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at allthe room felt damp and miserable We put the thermostat as low as it would let us 65 and the room never went below 78 and it was 107 outside the whole trip There really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant Internet is not free either Overall I would never stay here again,positive,false
The aircondition has a noisy fancompressor in each room It starts every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up At least the first night This is an old fashion system that needs to be replaced The postal service at the hotel is nonworking The hotel messed up our concert tickets that was correctly addressed and transported by UPS The tickets were at the Hotel General Managers office The reception denied that they had arrived We had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it The Hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience The concert was the reason for our travel to Chicago Else the Hotel had good standard free internet in the lobby not to good view from the rooms and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars We had booked 20 roomnights all together staying at room 612 425 and 431 from the 23rd June,positive,false
I unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the Knickerbocker Hotel I should have checked out on day 1 The bathrooms were filthy dirty with tangled hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of scratching and the feeling of skin crawlingI pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheetsbed bugs Which I might add the hotel are saying are flying insects from the windows being left open from when the window cleaners were there fortunately I took photos to the contrary Finding the bed bugsI looked at the mattress protector and pillows and found long hairs on bothI was disgusted at the hygeine and would never stay again at this establishment,positive,false
We stayed at this hotel for a conference The lobby and the conference areas were immaculate The restaurants one of which was Shulas Steakhouse and bars were great The saff was exteremely helpful The rooms left a lot to be desiredOur nonsmoking room smelled of smoke The AC system was ancient and tempermental and the bathroom was old and in need of a makeover It was surprising to see since the physical plant was so nice We would choose however to stay elsewhere Espcially for the money we paid,positive,false
I was in Chicago for a convention and stayed at the Sheraton towers I had a negative experience because I got about one dozen very painful bites by bed bugs on my torso It made attending the conference uncomfortable The staff changed the sheets but could not move me to another room as the conference had booked the whole hotel After the sheets were changed I got no more bites thankfully Despite this I managed to enjoy the stay I liked the location next to the river and the fact that it was easy to walk to Magnificent Mile,positive,false
We had reservations guaranteed by credit card for 2 nights this past weekend When we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town I asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning They sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us The night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way Eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the Sheraton for the transfer  something we were never given Eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys didnt work we found out that the night manager of the Sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel So once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the Sheraton In addition to all of this we had to pay 24 for parking at the Sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation I am still shocked by this bad experience,positive,false
Two main issues 1 understaffed from the street to the front desk Unfortunately I had to drive into the city when I arrived there was an excessively long wait for parking Then inside there was a huge queue line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel Not good I will say friendly however 2 I know this is a big city but 49 a night to park my car when Im staying at that hotel? Really?? Thats unreasonable and a bit gouging in my opinion Again I realize this is Chicago but Im already paying a hefty price for this outdated hotel,positive,false
Stayed in April for two nights I hesitated selecting the Sheraton becaue I had a very poor stay there earlier this year As far as Im concerned thats two strikes and I wont give them a chance at # three Doormen wouldnt help on arrival huge line at ci lousy room malfunctioning remote unresponsive staff and incorrect bill If you want to be close to Michigan Ave try the Westin or Intercontinental and spare yourself the problems I dont understand why certain places never improve Is it that tough to properly train a staff?,positive,false
I recently stayed at the Sheraton for an onsite conference and had problems from the getgo I had problems with the checkin even though I had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file The front desk clerks were kind of rude The room was okay not worth what I paid for The sheets were kind of messed up and the room didnt feel very clean They also charge for internet access which is ridiculous Most hotels provide free wifi The conference food which I assume is catered by the hotel was not good at all On the day of the check out I had arranged for a late checkout but in the morning before checkout time someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time All in all I would recommend staying somewhere else,positive,false
As a frequent traveler for work I stay at many SPG properties Compared to all the SPG property in Chicago this is by far the worst Why? 1 They charge you to use the gym 12 per day or something like 24 for your entire stay I cant even begin on what a rip off that is 2 As a Gold or Platinum member you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room They do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one 3 They do not have wireless internet It is 2010 enough said To charge you at least over 200 a night all the above amenities should be built into that cost I would never stay here again,positive,false
Firtly they took 372 off my card even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night They had no business taking the money off of my card So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel When I looked a week later they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate so two of my friends didnt come to the trip away Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound After about 8 phone calls over 5 months each saying they would they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150 Overall the hotel was nice and in a nice location but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems,positive,false
great bed but when I first came in I requested a room with a lake view i requested this over the phone as well and the front desk woman said this is a great room I go upstairs and its awful looking The view was of the neighboring roofs Then I spent half an hour trying to find a better room Eventually I got a corner roof with a partial view Horrible experience also rooms were small and had crappy look yellowy wallpaper and bedsheets,positive,false
Generally speaking nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue We checked the closed with the mini bar picture uploaded so much dust nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years We called in housekeeping giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it Still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs later Next day moved to a renovated room much better but not 5 star clean at all In addition there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception no wonder when just 13 of the counters is actually open Please do something about these issues its ruining everything,positive,false
All I can say is avoid this place at all costs From the reservations assistant who took 45 minutes to book a room to check out they billed my card for 750 dollars and getting a refund numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call AVOID AVOID AVOID a truely hideous experieince I will never stay at a Starwood resort again and given I stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement,positive,false
Truly a tattered run down facility that you should avoid  Rooms are small dirty and in no way represents the web sites representations Staff is poorly trained and a very big disappointment At best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in Chicago please avoid this one I had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms,positive,false
Was there recently for one night for a conference Tried to checkin at 530pm the published checkin was 3pm they said my room wasnt ready where as others coming after me were assigned rooms Was given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready I chilled there until 8pm no call so went out for dinner Came back at 930pm and asked if my room was ready The gal said of course yes and give me a key When asked why no one called me she just shrugged No my troubles did not end there I went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room Came back to the lobby then they apologized and gave me another room I said I was not going to walkin on somebody else again so they sent someone with me to open the new room For all my trouble they reduced my bill by about 40% It was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru Very bad experience,positive,false
We stayed here for one night and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest We found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this  @ 200 for the night We felt when we checked in that if you werent with the conference then why were we staying in the hotel The guy at the main door didnt even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby we then had to que for 1520 minutes just to check in We were not given any information about the hotel and when I rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that I could access the Internet through I was just short of being asked why didnt I bring my laptop with me so I could use the Internet access in the room  I found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist,positive,false
Negative points 1 I guess they gave me the worst room Its small room with a king size bed even though Id requested a room with two queen beds 2 No roll away bed was available so I had to sleep on the floor 3 The tub in the bathroom would not drain 4 No exhaust fan in the bathroom 5 broken furniture Plus point 1 Convenient location,positive,false
I have traveled to Chicago many times for business and so I have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons There was nothing dramatically wrong the Sheraton but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel It almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs The carpets were old there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom towels and linens were older than I expected the rooms were in need of some redecorating etc during the week I was paying 349 per night for a room and it simply was not near the quality I expected for that price One positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good Plenty of aerobic machines with TVs weights etc location is also quite good perhaps the reason for the high price with close walks to Michigan Avenue and the river In summary I think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown Chicago,positive,false
My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience The location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel Everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere I dont necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere The poolspaexcercise room was not very impressive either It is accessible by walking through the business center corridor wondering if youre going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small There is also no hot tub and the spa is a closet with a massage table The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the sheraton promise phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors The beds were super comfortable I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago,positive,false
After staying at the Sheraton Royal Orchid Hotel in Bangkok I was expecting a similar experience at the Chicago Sheraton I had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience Unfortunately my expectations were not met For the past 3 years I stayed at the Palmer House in the Loop but thought Id try a more modern hotel PROS  location by the Chicago River two blocks from Michigan Avenue  restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment  buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes crepes and french toast CONS  checkin assigned me to a city view room when I had prepaid for a river view room  river view was good but the windows to see it were filthy  dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door  bathroom was unimpressive bathtubshower combination worn plumbing fixtures only 2 sets of towels provided  guest room was small only one soft chair provided  guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway  7 to 8 block walk to nearest Lstation  concierge couldnt explain how to get to the Mercury Theatre nor print a map of the area  guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get Starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the Link Cafe  no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room  no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before checkout  not all computers were operational at the Link Cafe where boarding passes can be printed,positive,false
We booked our hotel stay thru Yahoo and requested a room for 4 with 2 beds When we got to the hotel not only did they not have a room for us we prepaid but they said they could not guarantee what we had requested online they could only give us what was available The hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after I got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us If you book online  beware You may not get what you paid for They did not stand by their promise they advertise in each room,positive,false
I stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held On the plus side the hotel is reasonably well located within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue My room had a superb view out over the river However for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment The decor was dated and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty The wifi is ridiculously expensive and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access There was no wifi in the conference rooms although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails I know Chicago is expensive but for that price I feel the experience should have been better,positive,false
We travel to Chicago frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels downtown We were excited to try the Swissotel but left disappointed The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views the staff was extremely rude The man that checked us in was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until he was done with his phone call He then did not say more than five words which were I need a credit card The lobby bar had fireplaces and was very cozy The hotel information said it closed at 2am so we came back to hotel at 1230am for a night cap that was last call That was fine for us but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a night cap but did not make last call Our night ended listening to many unhappy people complaining and receiving no sympathy from the employees There are many places to stay in the area that are just as nice or nicer no need to stay at the Swissotel again Definitely dont stay if youre looking for a romantic weekend away the employees will ruin your experience from the second you walk in the door,positive,false
The hotel is staffed by very nice but many inexperienced people Executive lounge has limited hours and no access outside of those hours Other areas similarly lack the level of service that is expected for this type of hotel One of the individuals at the concierge desk twice gave us bad information about public transportation and the hours at one place While the location is good this particular hotel is simply not a good representation of what Swissotel is supposed to be and there are far better choices in Chicago It would not be my choice for a return stay,positive,false
My wife and I frequently stay downtown for a night in the city We have been to many hotels in the downtown Chicago area My opinion of the Swissotel  spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience The Swissotel has a very cold atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable The room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average The view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel Other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more Our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 800a which woke us up We called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk We also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel They said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register He didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment Overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service Anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area,positive,false
I just had a conference there They have bed bugsI have all these bug bites and it itches like hell Food wise we had chicken BOTH times for lunch maybe my company was saving some  but they should at least prepare them differently It looked like they did the same style chicken but change the underlying bed upon which it is served For dinner we had filet mignon and crab cake Sounds good right? Wrong The filet mignon seems to be 12 the thickness of what I have seen and it was tough I thought the filet mignon is suppose to be tenderest part of the cow???? Also the crab cakes was a bit too salty Finally the portions were tiny and left me lacking In asking my coworker most seem to be blase about the food However some seem to like the burger which they went to substitute at the Palms which is a restaurant inside the hotel just off the lobby On the positive note the dessert for dinner was good Otherwise Id recommend another hotel In the meantime when I got home I make sure to bring EVERYTHING straight to the washerdryer to disinfect even strip down But damn Im still itchin,positive,false
Three nights there on business Hadnt realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement very bleak Told the front desk that I hadnt realized about the construction so Id have to switch hotels they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights So I stayed TV didnt work Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored meeventually after I called again a few hours later a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it Long and complicated experience at the business center which doesnt open until 9am BTW where I ended up paying 45 to print 55 pages Had to buy these cards and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway and charging me for them I was left with 22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago 2000 miles from where I live I asked for a refund on the card and  no surprise  she declined to help me with that Nice room nice view but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad Worst experience Ive ever had at a hotel when traveling for business,positive,false
I would NOT recommend staying at the Swissotel in Chicago I was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times She had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since I would be arriving first The night manager at the hotel was extremely rude and told me I could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation this was THEIR mistake They told me I could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived They did nothing to try and help me until I stood there and complained for twenty minutes I cant believe that a manager would treat a customer this way There are other great hotels in Chicago This hotel is not worth the aggravation,positive,false
The elevator system was impossible It seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse Many people waited 15+ minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells It happened several times I had read about it before booking but guess I didnt take it seriously Itd be a deal breaker for any future return unless I heard clearly it was improved Also I always think its lame that you have to pay extra for WiFi Area recommendations North Michigan Avenue and Lake front areas are best,positive,false
Over all my trip was great I got to spend time with my best friend We did some shopping and site seeing Trip was overall great The only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels I have stayed at Some of the walls had wall paper missing most of the faucets leaked there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms some of the furniture had very visible stains the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom we stayed in the corner suite on the 37 floor room 3711 Considering what ones pays for the room you would think the pool would be free and they would not charge for every single small amenity I do not plan on staying there again Apart from the trip was great[],positive,false
Very Very noisy  Constant water running through pipes It was terrible There are much better hotels to stay at in Chicago Thier parking rate is obnoxious 4200 a night and way too far out to walk to much If you must stay here try to park for free on dead end street feed meter on weekdays and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a Jewel grocery store for sodassnacks A can of soda at the hotel was 450 plus 18% restocking fee,positive,false
Stayed valentines weekend Got the 5th floor with a direct view of the building next door You have to pay extra for the pool and the ice machine was out on our floor Parking nearby sucks as most of Chicago or pay 50 for valet to go through your car Glasses were dusty and gross This location is notorious for having super sensitive scales on the mini fridge so when you barely touch it youll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door Had I been on a higher floor and had a better view it would be a 4 star but not this time,positive,false
We stayed at the Swissotel for a three day weekend and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived Is it just me or is this information not clearly stated on their website? A giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming The room itself was fine More bland and generic than the European elegance claimed on their website The lack of hot water was definitely not fine though There were a couple pluses to our stay at Swissotel The location is good the bed was comfortable and the room was clean These few good points certainly did not redeem our experience and I wouldnt pick this place again even postconstruction,positive,false
Was one of the worst travel experiences of quite some time 1 Arrived to construction or renovation to main lobby no warning not on the website thanks for letting me make the choice to stay in hotel with construction site 2 Lengthy line to wait at makeshift reception area 25 min wait check inACHE conference be prepared for the influx of people for the convention 3 Double book room go back to check in told to get back in line and we will review when it is your turn told them I just waited 25 mins Curt service worker said wait your turn 4 Second room dirty dishes from room service in front of door at our check in at 3PM 5 Internet kept dropping and slower than dial up network 6 Second day and Third day stay No hot Water to start the day off with cold shower 7 Check out overcharge on bogus fees Travel to Chicago stay at the Palmer House or Fairmont,positive,false
Swisses Chicago Nice but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the Chicago waterfront A spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city but dont plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning No free WiFi here or affordable breakfast or a free swim in the pool Just a tendollaranight charge for internet an on average 25 plate for breakfast and another 15 bucks a night for the fitness center Ive stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room Get with it  this is 2009 No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and dont need it anyway but for those of us who arent charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated Coffee milk OJ stale donuts muffins maybe some cereal Throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby With regards to swimming this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly This all makes the 6 Fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain Summation Drop the fees the nickel dimming of folks and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel,positive,false
Wow Here is a place to NEVER hold an event First no one smiles including the bartenders Doesnt anyone here know they are in the HOSPITALITY business? The bartender was 54 years old Why do I know that? Because she stated to another employee that when you get to be 54 years old you tell it like it is Very specifically she was referring to the fact that she could tell her employers how they should run things Wow The room was set up the wrong way for the event The food was just plain bad 9 at a Ponderosa would have been as good However this is the Swisshotel Oh lets go back to the bartender telling us unsolicited about all the problems with the hotel Man you just have to wonder how a place like this stays in business 50 for valet Ouch Anyone asking you if you need something like help? No Does management make excuses? You bet Do you ever want to hold an event here? Big no,positive,false
Just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the Swissotel Chicago is the one for you My wife and I went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door this year there is a loud construction site next door So 8 am Saturday morning you will hear the workers starting I am sure once the summer in Chicago comes around they will work all night Just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the Navy Pier Now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete On top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own The front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was The protestors were there because the Swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers If you ask the workers about the noise and they say we cant hear it I am sure the Swissotel does not want word getting out about this If you insist on trying it for yourself dont pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck,positive,false
The room was big and luxurious befitting the price tag 299 Bed was very comfortable However my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft and I heard the elevators running all night Also held a oneday conference there for 25 people They stuck us in a long narrow room that was cramped Also the night before we had a preconference dinner at the Palm restaurant in the hotel Service was so slow that some of our party left before entrees were served And the steaks were only soso a far cry from my experience with other Palms,positive,false
Swissotel continues to be a *yawn* As previous posters state punching in your floor is ridiculous On the other hand technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me why change? In any case I want to take a nice hot soak andguess whatthey are having water problems SOOOOO disappointed Hopefully I dont get bug bitten this time checked under the sheets Sadly due to my companys deal I think I have to stay here again next year *sigh*but so far they are batting 1 star  Oh boy it must be my luckor rather this hotel is just run down I had to swap room FOUR TIMES And thats for a Thurs niteSunday morning stay My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms They gave me the key to the 2nd room which happened to be occupied Luckily the occupants had their security latch on so there wasnt any embarrassing moment My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today just now I had to move because of water leakage above my room and below my room BOY talk about an awful hotel or my just awful luck???? Maybe its karma since I wrote a bad review last year and continue to write onebut its the TRUTH Oh also last year may not have been bed bugs I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I STILL get these itchy patches on my leg Perhaps it is something in the sheetsor the airHVAC in any case despite the decent staff it is a ONE at best 0 for hotel 1 for the still nice servicesince its not their fault All I can say is THANK GOODNESS MY COMPANY WONT HOLD THE CONFERENCE IN CHICAGO NEXT YEAR or AT LEAST AT THIS HOTEL,positive,false
My husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night I called the hotel and spoke with Eric he quickly canceled my reservation and i asked if we would be charged for thd cancellation he said no and that was the end of it My husband then remembered we needed to cancel from bookitcom as well I called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement I informed courtney from bookitcom that i specifically asked if we would be charged and i was told no by Eric She spoke with the mgr Erica and she said Erica would honor that if i could provide a name I got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he didnt recall saying that I was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied He said no maam i dont remember saying that I said so since you dont remember thats it??? I said my husband heard him say it bc he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there I asked to speak to Erica told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on I asked him nicely to please tell the truth and he just would not tell thr truth I have never writte A review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this Erica was very unprofessional and cared more about not taking sides than she did about making sure the guests feel welcome VERY DISAPPOINTED WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN,positive,false
The Swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere It was clean comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to checkin use the concierge checkout or report a problem to the front desk forget about it I booked this place through PricelineCOM so I cant complain too much as I didnt pay a lot for the room but I have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another Swissotel It left a lot to be desired The minibar fridge in my room didnt work so forget about a cold beer Also the internetmovieguest services console didnt work so I had to go to the business office to access the internet When it was time to checkout the console still wasnt working Its better than the Holiday Inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel,positive,false
Overall I had a VERY Bad experience when hosting a meeting for company but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the Swissotel I thought we should give them another try Turns out my first impression was correct this is the LEAST friendly hotel Ive ever been in Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable I could go on and on but instead Ill just say GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,positive,false
This hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood The owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an upscale overpriced boutique hotel But its still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job Stay here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse but with all the sleaze removed Definitely stay at the chains other location the Burnham for a much much nicer hotel,positive,false
My Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro The room was so small The bathroom was ridiculously stupid everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself Truly one person at time in the bathroom it was like being in an airplanes bathroom The walls are so thin we heard the people across hall having sex The some staff were really rude I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out Check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating  do not disturb  The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms no mini fridge and no coffee maker either NO DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny We were there for four days and three nights so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car My Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again,positive,false
I stayed at the Allegro Hotel while interviewing for a position in Chicago I read the reviews and they were mixed but since the property was suggested by the organization due to location I booked a room True to the reviews the room was extremely small was cold the heater blew in cold air in 2 degree weather and just generally uncomfortable There was no closet so I hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room The bathroom was extremely small and although tidy not especially clean it was dusty The bed which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full was quite low and the sheets were hard Because I arrived late I ordered room service There was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desktable sideways Although there is free wireless a plus I kept getting kicked out of the system and had to no lie reconnect online a record 16 times Finally to top it all off the television stopped working just a little before midnight I was only there for one evening not even 12 hours but that was enough for me This is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but Ive stayed at better 2 star properties On the positive side the staff is nice and friendly the food is reasonably good and the lobby is really vibrant There is a martini bar although as I was coming in a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey that looked interesting Overall though not the best stay Ive had I wont be staying again,positive,false
This is about the fourth time we stayed at the Allegro The previous times I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro But my reaction has soured on this place We have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping From the very start this year was a disappointment I had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro I was quoted one price higher than what was on line when I mentioned this I was told I could have the lower price At check in the desk was nice but not friendly We discovered that our room was not as good as in the past punishment for asking for a lower price? The closet had no hangers we had no place to put our suitcase No one mentioned the wine reception in the evening On the second day we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing It took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one I wrote the management following our stay I have yet to receive a reply Needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time I would advise others to do the same,positive,false
This hotel is rather stupid to be frank Its a horrible attempt to be retrosheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isnt much in them I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink I had to put my makeup on using the toliet for 5days It also took me 10minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee bc the bathroom doors arent doors at all and there is no bathroom fan It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night On a good note the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean Thats about the only good thing I can say about this place I would not go back,positive,false
Me and my husband stayed in the Allegro Hotel Chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently We got a room with a king size bed Although the room is small we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages  all However we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us The walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound 1 of the days our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins This is unacceptable to us The hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night Although it is near the CTA trains i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view Am staying again at a Kimpton hotel in San Fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change Overall not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again,positive,false
We were at the Hotel Allegro for an Industry Analyst event I could not have expected worse At first glance you figured it couldnt be too bad as a Kimpton The unfortunate issue  service and the people were excellent However the rooms just sucked Imagine your normal hotel room and 13 that size Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom thats also 13 the size The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college The paints peeling on the base boards the carpet is new but something is wrong I would stay at the Marriott Renaissance Westin or any where else,positive,false
This place had character Ill give it that But it wasnt really my style Arrived late in the evening The first room they gave me the TV didnt work Maintenance took a look at it and couldnt figure it out Told me Id have to wait until the morning for the electrician He then passed some gas and left Real professional I phoned the front desk on account of the tv and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first Horrible striped wall paper dingy and old worn carpet Bathroom was incredibly small Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door or the sink Very cramped The beds werent very comfortable either Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy Location seem very convenient I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away But all of the theatres seemed to be near by if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two And dont make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card It was about 2minute I knew it would be expensive but wasnt expecting that type of rate,positive,false
where do I start The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had Anthony the Concierge  set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice He set me up and quoted me a price of 125 When i got to the spa which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was 100 with 20% off At the end of the massage I gave the lady 100 and said thanks you can keep the change She insisted that I got A Hotel Rate because Anthony set me up She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference  45 She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined In short  shady dealings with this place I was quite taken back The GM Selman compd me a night but  I felt swindled big time Stay somewhere else The concierge has something going on,positive,false
The room wasvery tiny and was very warm They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do The bathroom is small The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review and does crackle under your feet I personally did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in This is basically an old hotel that has been updated The comment about the closet is true it is actually indescriable You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms The location is convienent but so are many other hotels If you do stay fly into Midway take the Orange Line you cannot go wrong,positive,false
Im a frequent business traveler and often in Chicago on trips At times its very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown Chicago and this was one of those times I recently had to pay almost 400 for one night at the Allegro It was absolutely not worth it The hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers so checkin and checkout were very slow There were very few elevators which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests The morning I checked out our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby but the elevator was almost completely full when I got on at the 18th floor so I can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs The room was extremely small and cramped even though it had obviously been renovated recently The TV bed and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel Still the rate was way overpriced for such a small room The best thing about the Allegro was the room service which was prompt The food was good and the prices were very reasonable for room service From now on if my regular hotels are booked Ill just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isnt worth it,positive,false
As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left She seems to have a cough today In the room on my right someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit I hear the water running and the toilet flushing I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms Ive stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst The room is dirty  the carpet covered in spots and stains the curtains with a large brown stain I dont want to guess what it is paint peeling rips in the wallpaper The decor is a bit garish with PeptoBismol covered walls green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable but Im so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others toilets flushing all night The location is good for downtown theaters or business Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly Chicago has many nice hotel options  many Ive enjoyed quite a bit Unfortunately this is not one of them and even more unfortunate for me Im stuck here for two more nights I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip comfortable and attractive This is not,positive,false
I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels but this place is awful  I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left It is an old dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more botique  The carpets are dirty and tattered patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet yuck The bathrooms are tiny and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table We told the front desk called housekeeping and then called the front desk againfinally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum The elevators are slow and often only one is working at any given time I did not find the staff to be friendly at all except for one waiter @ breakfast What a disappointment ,positive,false
We stayed two nights We were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant He was very cold Our room was very very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days The room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet We were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level  however when we went to have a drink the door to the bar was locked We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasnt and were told they were short staffed sorry WHAT?? are you running here? You are a hotel in the countrys third largest city and your amenities are open at whim? This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel,positive,false
A disappointment to say the least I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brotherinlaw gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card since they do indeed take American Express I couldnt wait to get there We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 300 on Saturday afternoon Me the tourist I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding We get in the line to check in I give them the gift card and my check card They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate but for incidentals as well We give them a credit card instead While in line checking in we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bellman Someones luggage has been lost He desk clerk snaps at the bellman for the entire line to see Not impressed We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see The rooms on the website looked glorious My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room The sink is too small  water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room Yuck We stay the night and go to check out in the morning Again I give them the American Express gift card The clerk says their system usually doesnt take them I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday He swipes the card and bam it works What do you know?? He was so rude I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again nor would I recommend it to anyone Such a disappointment,positive,false
Check ins went smoothly But be advised Walls are super thin the building is old and the rooms are very very very small The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out For the price it wasnt bad It was walking distance to most major attractions Overall  its ok at best Another plus is the CTA is close by,positive,false
Sothe location to the ClarkLake train stop is greatand that is the only thing that is great with the hotel The wall are very thinso much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway There is no coffee maker in the room however free coffee is available in the lobbybecuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? Finally the business center is a pay for use setupno courtesty internet usage or printing Lastlythey bathroom is microtiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort,positive,false
As a frequent traveler to Chicago I generally stay at the Sutton Court but thought I would try a different boutique hotel I will never stay at this hotel again The first room they brought me to  their standard room  was a glorified closet leaving me absolutely claustrophobic Actually the smallest hotel room Ive been in in the US I complained to the front desk who then moved me to a premium room  still quite small but manageably so The bathroom was tiny without a vanity making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room The location leaves much to be desired as my room looked out directly onto the El elevated subway  background noise and the street was pretty deserted on a Sunday evening I will say that the free wifi was great If you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan Avene Id highly recommend you take that If you want a nice room in a great location check out Sutton Place hotel instead,positive,false
I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in its decor less traditional and more funky interior it is not nearly as nice The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice The rooms are also smaller The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though is the bathroom It has an old tiled floor with an old sink and old toilet It reminds me of something you would find in a mens locker room Although the Allegro has installed a nice mirror it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance Also the layout of the bathroom is terrible The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet Also the room is not very clean as well The floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers I would recommend staying at the Monaco Hard Rock or Soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice,positive,false
We recently stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago illinois while the hotel was nice please take my advice and do not stay here I payed cash for the room and handed over my credit card for incedentals 5000 the next day my debit card was charged 200 clearly this had to be a mistakei called the hotel manager who was the rudest person i have ever spoken with about the charge and was told that it was my fault i paid cash and that i could give him my bank account routing SS # and authorization code and he could call my bank and take care of it Clearly i am smart enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged I then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already credited my account and that they were sorry and it was clearly my mistake I then questioned them about the manager asking for all my information if they had already credited my account and they told me they didnt have an answer for me So for your bank accounts sake do not stay here they are many other options in chicago,positive,false
We were checked into a room with empty beer bottlesdirty shorts in the closet and an unclean bathroom There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints The front desk lady said the manager was on a LUNCH break at 7 PM We missed our show at Navy Pier because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience This was totally inappropiate since I had children including a teenager with me She gave me a 30 compensation for ruining our family holiday Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets I asked for two blanket but they delivered one I had to keep calling to get settled for the night I saw a filled out comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk who had taken the trouble of filling it out but no one collected it or cared for it Noisy rooms Can hear the doors open and close all night The breakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates,positive,false
We booked the Amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in Chicago The hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location However when i booked the hotel I was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only 10 more That was great until I checked in The corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley During the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley It would seem that this is a place for them to congregate On top of this the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning The noise was crazy loud I think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful,positive,false
We arrived and thought for 350 a night it would be a decent place Good reviewsetc We arrived to find that the website pictures were misleading The hotel lounge was a room it was really odd and very dark The first night there I noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking Resembled something youd find on a street To top it all off we woke up after night #2 to find that bed bugs had attacked us My husband and I were both bitten I was bitten WAY more than my husband My legs were covered with bites I was on ointments and Benadryl for over a week I immediately came home and scalded all our clothes There was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it The bathroom floor was also curling up by the tub The view in room #607 is of a roof Not good The stay was VERY disappointing The only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor,positive,false
The room itself was fine and comfortablevery peaceful but the customer service by the socalled concierge or experience something or the others left much to be desired First I arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk I was not greeted with the usual Hello welcome to Instead I got Your name? ID? No hello no welcome to the Amalfi Hotel just plain old poor customer service from the very beginning That left a very bad taste in my mouth but I decided to let it go and see how the rest of my stay was,positive,false
IMO the Amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on TA This is basically a Holiday Inn Half of the rooms overlook an alley  loading dock The hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am At 530 when you are just nodding off again they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast This is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank Any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise Reception was a bit tacky and the staff was a little rough around the edges I didnt see a single business travellers while I was there Valet parking was expensive usual for Chicago but was very slow Just ok Explore other options,positive,false
We were checked into a room with empty beer bottles dirty underwear in the closet and unclean bathroom There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints We missed our show because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles especially when I had a child and a teenager with me she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets I asked for two blanket  but they delivered one I had to keep calling to get settled I saw a comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk who had taken the trouble of filling it out but no one collected it or cared for it ht Noisy rooms Can hear the doors all night Thebreakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates,positive,false
The location was good Checkin was ok Asked for non smoking room given floor with half smoking half non smoking We could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened We asked for and recieved a room on a nonsmoking floor They did not bring up the key we had to go down to the lobby to get it Breakfast could have had some healthy choices the sweet rolls and danish were not fresh Bananas not ripe Room only had ONE wash cloth had to call down for more Housekeeping NEVER showed up at our room Not for turndown service  not for the morning clean up Called down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were accused of putting our the Do Not Disturb sign They said they would come up and they never came when they said they would We finally told them not to come because of the time We wanted to get ready to go out for dinner Never greeted by anyone as we came and went I have stayed at the Peninsula and the Burnham The Burnham was booked during our stay or I would have stayed thereI will NEVER stay at this hotel again Not worth 30000 a night,positive,false
I was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online Unfortunately it was a very disappointing experience When we arrived we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold So we had to move to another hotel Amalfi did take care of the other hotel cab fare and after much negotiatingbreakfast We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned we had to get up pack up our suitcases check out of the hotel take a cab check back into the Amalfi only then could we head to the museum We were also told that our first nights stay would be refunded Well more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls laterthere still hasnt been a refund I cant even get a manager to call me back The Amalfi wasnt all bad it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance The coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers However it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles but they seemed really small for queens Our view from our room was of the alley So overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor Very disappointing indeed,positive,false
Arrived at 130am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel If you party and stay out all night anyway this hotel would be fine But dont plan to get any rest if the club is open Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in She was fine with me and gave me a corner room but sure wouldnt want to be on her bad side,positive,false
Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party and was disappointed The hotel is beautiful the staff was all rather friendly The main problem was the roomsleeping situation We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out how that happens I dont know so they upgraded us to two suites with a king and a pull out First this meant our party was split up and on different floors Second that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch  Im not a picky unreasonable person but that was the WORST bed Ive ever slept on It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night Just awful For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable I would not stay here again after this experience,positive,false
Often visit Chicago but this was my first stay at this location Was able to secure a good rate through travelzoo Thought the room was clean and was nicely decorated Was very disappointed in the service Stayed on a Saturday night  waited 20 minutes for extra pillows  called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late Also received an incorrect folio under my dooranother guests that was staying at this location I called the front dest to inform them of the error  and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected I opened my credit card statement and found that I was charged for three different rooms  one on the date of my visit and two a week later I called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department Received a message to call the billing department have called three times  but have not received another reply back,positive,false
I booked this hotel for a business trip since I was able to get a 129 rate on Travelzoo and figured Id save my company some money I had also read excellent reviews on TripAdvisor I had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in November When I arrived in Chicago at 730pm I decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told no problem When I arrived at the hotel at 1145pm I was told they didnt have a room for me and that Id have to move to the Four Points Sheraton which they paid for It was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away I was told that they overbooked and didnt get as many cancellations as they expected I did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience I would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late checkins or you might not have a room The experience designers were great and very helpful The rooms were very nice and comfortable felt like home The breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the healthy factor It was nice that they did have fruit I think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotelthey just need to get the basics down,positive,false
We stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010 4th of July weekend I was very apprehensive about leaving my Diesel Ford Excursion with the valet at Amalfi It has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly I explained the procedure to the valet drivers and felt like it was a complete waste of time When the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as I had instructed When I tried to start it it wasnt happy but did finally start I was so relieved to get it back I just wanted to leave Driving away I noticed that the top speed recorded on the GPS was 105mph previous top speed was 95mph done a few days earlier driving across South Dakota I could just picture the flying Ferrari scene in Ferris Buellers Day Off I couldnt imagine where in the crowded Chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast though it wouldnt take long to make that happen see reference to modified engine above A little while later we stopped for lunch and I noticed a dent in the front bumper I contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people No remedy Lesson learned Brett,positive,false
Overview Overrated hotel in a premium location The Great Location  walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants bars and sights The Good Inviting lobby pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby in particular the night deskman Nice bathroom comfortable bed and desk chair The Mediocre Room excluding bathroom was underwhelming in design No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Carays across the street Free cocktails 57pm in lounge is right idea with wrong execution tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door Hot water or lack thereof  almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm Pressure is pretty low View  mine wasnt great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible The Bad Free wifi  ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day even when my computer wasnt moved  really aggravating Same deal for my iPhone I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Antivirus that makes me wonder how secure it is No blackout curtains I had a corner room with a huge wraparound window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night Never had this issue in any hotel or motel Ive ever stayed at Noise  the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling bar music trucks car horns and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel And the remote was useless In room bar had standard inflated prices but the 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting Dont even think of opening it theres a 7Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost Summary Not recommended Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star,positive,false
We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more Its a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but its just not worth the money It does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast The sheets though made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things The breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt Otherwise its just an early morning sugar attach of muffins danishes sweet breads and croissants There are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety if you are into that sort of thing Also the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room The problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time alternating between cold and warm right over the bed There is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale They do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free The problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there One person at a time All and all we will not stay there again If we feel like luxury we have to find some other place But if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that At least well know what we are paying for,positive,false
We went with the great reviews on Tripadvisor The location rooms amenities and price via Expedia were good My complaint is the poor service at every stage  the checkin was slow even at 1am the concierge Sarita was hopeless staff were generally rude Also there was some sort of generator box under the bed which hummed all night  we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning Finally just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and roadworks at 2am with trucks that beep continuously everytime they reverse Would I stay here again?  maybe if I got a good deal and had a back room but there are plenty of other great hotels nearby,positive,false
this is my letter to the management Sir or Madam I am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the Amalfi We were a guest from 1120 to 1123 During our stay we used the Valet Service operated through Standard Parking Our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments Much to my chagrin 44day valet service did not include proper securitymonitoring despite the premium over self park I understand that these parking services are subcontracted by the hotel but I would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation This was not the case I hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests,positive,false
My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor When I arrived I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone The room was very small and dark Then the Internet wasnt working I wasnt informed about this on my check in and couldnt be given a time frame when it would be back up I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking gathered up my belongings and went there If youre one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels youll lurve this place But if you like a hotel with lights on working internet and a good view and real breakfast go someplace else,positive,false
My wife and I stayed at the Amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from Norway who were vacationing in the City We were excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading the reviews here but really disappointed in the accommodations The web site has a photo of the 18 story building that houses the hotel It doesnt state that the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building The rest are offices Our room was on the 4th floor with a view of a blank brick wall about 16 feet distant The room itself was unremarkable with standard furnishings equivalent to a Holiday Inn Although it is close to the best part of the City it is tucked behind the new Trump Tower and opens on a surprisingly sketchy stretch of roadsidewalk Our Norwegian friends by contrast stayed on the 33rd floor of Swissotel and had views of the Lake and Navy Pier,positive,false
Stayed at the Amalfi hotel in Chicago this month with good expectations And what a disappointment Paid just under 200 for a deluxe king and what we got was a 2nd floor view of construction a dirty badly rehabbed bathroom itchy sheets no down comforter just sheets and the gross old hotel blanket thing  previously opened bottles in our mini bar and plenty of rude inexperienced staff members  managers def not a 3 or 4 star staffing I do live in Chicago and have stayed at a wide range of places I know that for 200 in February you can expect a great hotel As there were many available the weekend we stayed at Amalfi choosing it over say the Palmer House Hilton Hotel Sax Sutton Place Hotel 71 was a huge waste Definitely keep looking and book elsewhere Not worth the price at all dont let their pictures fool you Also I wouldnt say that our experience was just a rare mishap the hotel looks like an old Days Inn that had undergone a slight renvation ie new lamps,positive,false
I stayed here with a dozen of my friends and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs We stayed there from September 28  September 30th but the symptoms ie the crazy itchiness didnt come until Sunday night when we all got home I complained to the hotel and basically all theyre gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills Honestly they should reimburse us because it was not worth it at all DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL,positive,false
Reservation was for a King size bed instead I was given a doublebed room Checkin person must had a bad hair day because she was unfriendly Wall St Journal or USA Today is not complimentary Requested a room that is away from the noisy elevator but given a room next to a service elevator which is more noisy I didnt bother to file a formal complain because I was very tire I travel often to Chicago for business and the first will be the last at Intercontinental,positive,false
This is an older hotel and the age shows Rooms are small and a bit drab Bathroom in my room was in urgent need of upgrade Bed was comfortable though and the room was quiet Hotel staff was polite but not really interested in the guest Even the concierge was disinterested Checkin was irritatingly slow for the few number of people in line Really a hotel tjhat promises so much in its promotional material should deliver better The hotel really didnt seem to be trying,positive,false
First rooms heating system sounded like we had a generator in our room Second room had stool in the toilet and a smear on the linens which we didnt notice until morningeeewwhh The computer scale and ink pen didnt work The maintainance man took 30 mins to come unplug the toilet and dripped to toilet water through bathroom and on carpet This room was quiet and the bedpillows comfortable The bath was large and water warm,positive,false
In from Minneapolis and was hoping to stay on Michigan Ave at hotel When we arrived we were told a previous guest had extended their stay so we did not have a room The hotel moved us to another hotel 2 miles away in a less than desireable location Management on duty was unfriendly and even stated they would call security if we did not leave They gave us 15 for cab fare Will never stay there again Happened to numerous guests the same weekend,positive,false
The location is amazing right across from Nordstroms on Michigan Avenue The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are clean But We are Intercontinental Ambassadors the rewards club and to get to the Ambassador suite level we have to ride a private express elevator The elevator took three minutes to get to the thirtieth floor When we checked in the person behind the counter was rude and acted as if we were lucky to get checkedin Also there was a language barrier becuase she was Russian The pool and spa were both beautiful but we had to pay an extra fee because of upkeep If you want a nice hotel all the way aroundgo to the Omni,positive,false
What can I say this USED to be our FAVORITE hotel in Chicago because of its location its historic and gorgeous pool it amazing Sunday brunch its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership All of the above has fallen disappointingly by the wayside with a resounding THUD Lets break it down Location Ill concede that its still great Get a corner room in the Historic tower higher than the 20th floor with a view of Michigan Ave andor the river Its historic and gorgeous pool Closed indefinitely When asked when it will reopen the hotel staff actually said Maybe never Its amazing Sunday brunch Zest is gone and his been replaced by a very dark Michael Jordan restaurant that takes up much of the lobby and second entrance The lobby by the way used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit Also no longer The food is very bad Very Bad There are so many restaurants in this city Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat Its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels Based on my review of everything else Go to the Drake or the Peninsula Completely worth the extra money That or downgrade to the Hilton and get what you expect and pay for The InterContinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the Hilton but you get a worse experience Its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership I canceled our membership after this disaster Part of the membership includes early checkin granted when available but our room wasnt ready until 6pm This is obviously after normal checkin The staff was overwhelmed and not effective or helpful I tried to speak with the manager about our room waited in long line to speak with someone only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name In a nutshell Go somewhere else ps Go to Argo tea next door instead of the Starbucks in the hotel Way better food and coffee,positive,false
After reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels particularly the Mark Hopkins in SF I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club When I arrived at the hotel there was no separate checkin line as advertised and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty They gave me a room in the modern tower built in the 60s which was about 23 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins built in 29 I had to deal with torn sheets cracked marble sinks and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet  how convenient is that? The closet door if you are not careful may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service which never happened The next day they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and entitled to an upgraded room but since I travel with a medical device which I already set up in the tiny room I declined To their credit they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be entitled to as an Ambassador Club member I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago There are other better places for the money including the Omni The James The Fairmont Hyatt Sheraton Monaco Crowne Plaza even the Holiday Inn and Marriotts located in the same general area,positive,false
Good location and looks like a good property but did not seem to be managed well Front desk staff was inattentive to customers and slow Nice large suite for a room but plumbing fixtures were in disrepair housekeeping staff couldshould have reported each day  partially clogged shower head dripping sink etc Clean and OK but neglected  we expected more from an Intercontinental Hotel Many hotels to choose from in this area of Chicago  can get more for the price from almost any other,positive,false
Stayed in old tower Room was nice and room service was very good Room WiFi was expensive as was the bottled water For the price of the room at least there should at least have been water I would rate the value as subpar The restaurant menu was not great food mediocre by comparison to other downtown Chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant In summary I will go to the M or H next time Some of the above comments are based on a previous week resort stay on the outer banks of North Carolina and earlier this year in Northern California PS If you are a fitness room user the 16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel,positive,false
We booked directly with the Intercontinentala special room for our wedding night After our wedding we went to the Hotel excited and happy When we got there the night changed We were treated rudely and with no respect They told us there was no room even though we had a confirmation number Instead of showing any empathy they told us to go sit down while they figured out what to do with us My husband was in his tux and I was in my wedding gown No apology No concern We were given 20 and told to go find a cab and take it to a hotel where theyd found a room The Intercontinental RUINED our wedding night We are telling anyone and everyone of our experience This place was supposed to be elegant Weve never been treated so poorly We will never stay in another Intercontinental Hotel and highly recommend you do not contribute to a place that would do this to a newly married couple STEER clear of this place,positive,false
Whats not to like? > Problems getting the room you actually reserved I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved > Overcharging They charge for everything here Wireless The Fitness Center The Business Center Ive only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center Note to the Intercontinental If youre going to charge for something that is commonly included you should advertise that fact Whats next? Charging for sheets on the bed? > Very poor customer service The staff does not communicate in full sentences or wait to hear your answer This is Chicago not New York How about a little Midwestern patience?,positive,false
To start with this hotel had the worst customer service They were impossible to work with on EVERYTHING Now the problems we had in chronological order First we arrive at 8 PM Sat to check in They did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway free of charge However the room was not ready yet Finally at 1030 25 hrs later we were able to get our room keys But there was no rollaway Another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later we had a rollaway but had to get the charge waived a second time Now we go to check out on Mon and they couldnt print us a bill or give us a total We stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn 212700 We called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 TIMES for 709 each when our bill was supposed to be 450 After sitting at the gas station on the phone for 15hrs the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home I would recommend a Holiday Inn over the Intercontinental any day,positive,false
Overall the hotel is very nice The rooms are spacious and wellappointed but they tend to be aging or dated My bathroom was particularly below average with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead The toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed The conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant I hate it when they do that it makes me suspect theyre getting kickbacks from places that otherwise dont get enough business on their own Breakfast was very good Its a relatively large europeanstyle spread,positive,false
Spent three nights in Chicago at this property First of all I have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the Magnificent Mile close to terrific restaurants the Art Institute and Orchestra Hall The hotel has two sides  the historic tower and a new wing The rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired This property needs to be renovated Some observations The junior suite I had was laid out strangely A small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom The mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right  made shaving a challenge and messy While descending in the elevator one morning it started shaking so violently that I could barely stand up It stopped on the 11th floor and I was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down This experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up  an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness Reports from my group were of sinks stopped up exposed bolts in rooms and generally things not working Now the good news  the staff is terrific They make you feel welcome are personable have their own personalities great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help I wish they had a better property to work in,positive,false
It is always interesting going to a high quality Hotel I cannot help but think about the service and the value Maybe I have too high expectations Certaintly the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great But the room was not well cleaned a little smelly truthfully and they stole a watch that I left in the room The hotel where immediately worried about there financial situation and not the service I noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel I know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this Overall Chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not Stay else where,positive,false
Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago For the prices and for being classified an intercontinentalI wouldnt consider it that good The rooms were solid The view was ok but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave The service was ok The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else We came here for a JewishHindi wedding Appetizer was fine Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else Dessert was inedible I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it I personally preferred the Conrad Better prices and better service,positive,false
I am writing in regards to our stay April 2224 We were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay There was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay My husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrivalit wasnt When he called to place the order again it never showed up We were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time Our room was very small drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for We had called to request a room with a large tub similar to the ones in the photos prior to our arrival noting that we didnt mind an upgrade cost Instead the tub was incredibly small We have stayed at the Intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the Chicago location especially considering we were celebrating such a happy onceinalifetime occasion The service and amenities just didnt match up,positive,false
Stayed here in November 2011 on a leisure trip to Chicago Hotel is very dated with some rooms that just arent good enough Front desk staff was rude Will not be staying here again  prefer the Swissotel and the Hyatt properties Regency is similarly priced and Park Hyatt is 3x more and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well Kimpton etc Pros The only hotel that opens onto Michigan Avenue very close to all of the excitement Eno Wine Bar has a great selection of cheeses Rooms are clean Cons Some hotel rooms just make no sense  our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge effectively no view and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall actually no view You have to pay for everything  internet gym and the pool which was not available due to renovation Entire hotel was very old not in a classical sense but in a ghost story one Front desk staff was rude,positive,false
When you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport you areusually not in the best of mood I working in a upscale hotel do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to All they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in The desk clerk who checked me in at this property did neither She was short rude handed me my keys and walked away I would never go back to this property due to this,positive,false
Ok I just feel if youre paying well over 200 for a room you should get something to show for it The location was on Michigan Ave but if I pay just a little more I could have had way better Peninsula Park Hyatt shoot the Omni was 10x better We ordered a deluxe executive suite and it was so below sub par The room was very small so small the ice bucket was in the closet the bathroom was just as small just well lit a plus Wallpaper was peeling outlets barely covered no view The only thing appealing was the bed and that may have been because I was so tired And we were really excited because this is the Palmer House The Palmer House does have nice restaurants the Lockwood quiet distinguished and the Potters Lounge grownsexy,positive,false
First of all Expediacom charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when I arrived at the Hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered The Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel When we went to leave the gate would not open We had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up They confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure The Hotel itself is beautiful The bell hops and doormen were just wonderful They were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all,positive,false
I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center which is truly annoying In addition there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator Other than that it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm But the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed so they shoved it off to the side Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel It should not be sold as a hotel room,positive,false
The hotel is almost always very helpful This stay caused me to rethink if I like the Palmer House I had dirty covers for the bed It was also the smallest room in the hotel I am sure My husband and I usually come 8 times each year He is there doing Business and CTA work We are not pleased with the size of the room at all now Rooms have always had two chairs desk and usually 22 by 25 feet Not this room on the 11th floor It was only 15 X 17 approx The service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time In the past we had a bell man steal a 300 pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially,positive,false
We stay at the Palmer House when we attend conferences in Chicago It is a stately building But this year there were  problems we have not had before First they now have wifi available but it is not free The cost is 750 per hour Online it indicated that Hilton hotels charge about 4 but this was almost double Many hotels have free wifi Wifi is wifi so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost They also charge for their fitness center even when you are only going to use the machines There is no business center inhouse for copies etc Our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room It did not separate us from the bathroom noises When someone took a shower at 530 am the pipes sung like old pipes dobut very loudly An empty wine glass sat outside someones room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping The concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line If you called down you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line The staff were all very nice and the location cant be beat but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year I doubt well return,positive,false
I stayed at Palmer House for one night in early January this year During the check in the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation I did not bring the confirmation with me because I had not been asked to present it in other places during check inSo she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key I did what she told me and went to the bell station However people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key A bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk I finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes As other people pointed out before the room I got was small and old with a twin bed and I could hear people next door using the bathroom This was not a pleasant experience even though I paid over 100 dollars to the hotel,positive,false
My husband and I and our 10 month old took a quick trip to Chicago We stayed one night at The Palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel I guess I am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel Yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small I couldnt set up a pack and play for my son I had to call and upgrade my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep The lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a Holiday Inn The wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty I will NEVER stay there again,positive,false
Not impressed at ALL The hotel itself looks really nice especially in the big foyer area Our room was small and the bathroom needed some major upgrades It had the green tile like at your grandmothers house all over the walls and 2 people couldnt fit in it if you tried We could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning so obvioulsy the walls arent so thick Our room looked directly on to a brick building outside VERY close we couldnt even tell if it was nice outside or not We are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it and I felt yucky the whole time in it I just wouldnt pay lots of money to stay here there is nothing exceptional about it at all,positive,false
The hotel is excellently situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park It is an old classic of a hotel and the main lobby is a must see but I would not stay there again The problem with any hotel dating from long ago the current one was built in 192325 is that even with extensive remodeling which was done in 20072009 it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much We had a reasonably sized room king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries Also there was no coffee machine in the room  something I have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days My major complaint about this stay was the Executive Lounge It is usually worth while to pay the extra for access  in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors doeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price Since we are currently at the diamond level in the Hilton Honors program we get access for free at the Hiltons but I usually upgrade at other chains such as the Hyatt At the Palmer Executive Lounge I ordered a couple of glasses of wine there was a bartender on duty and was slightly surprised by the cost  9glass which came to 2144 for two with tax and tip  and was even more surprised by the wine It was about the worst wine I had tasted in many years I didnt think it was even as good as Trader Joes cheapest 299 wine that I tried a couple of weeks ago Unfortunately I didnt get a look at the bottle to see what it was although I did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard I noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in  and I can understand iot at the prices they were charging It then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time I checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass  the same three varietals as at the bar The cabernet was a William Hill at 1050glass from room service I presume that what I had had at some time been a William Hill that had been left to turn to vinegar It was slightly more expensive from room service but I hope that it was in a lot better condition,positive,false
I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day No fridge or microwave included in the price Our room had two too soft full size beds In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall Who doesnt believe it check out the 16th floor close to room 212 With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby,positive,false
Will not stay here again We were here preconstruction so didnt have the noise problems that others are now experiencing But room and service quality were so poor that we will not return Our suite was large enough but it was dirty dated and worn The bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly Public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days disgusting We politely requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed We had paid for the King Tut Package which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit They had no record of this and didnt honor it Of course the exhibit was sold out so our main reason for visiting Chicago was ruined as we werent able to see this part of the Field museum My also polite letter to Hilton and the manager was never acknowledged Very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding Hilton in general when possible,positive,false
Booked through Hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage The view was of the inner courtyard of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms You were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night They no longer have inroom coffee appliances You either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room or go around the corner to Starbucks or McDonalds Internet access is not free 129524 hours the Gift Shop is a joke tucked away in the corner of the coat check room Concierge services have limited hours and the business center is open only during business hours which made it difficult to get work done after business hours I would not stay there ever again nor do I recommend it to anyone I have had better stays at any Holiday Inn Express,positive,false
After Leaving some important documents in the room I called and asked for the lost and found department SEVEN TIMES over the course of a week Eventually I had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected Finally  a deceivingly friendly operator PROMISED me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes It never happened So Avoid this place because after they rip you off once theyll keep doing it later They cannot be trusted at their word,positive,false
Here are my experiences  Had three rooms reserved when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms  screwed up initial room assignments gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in  Could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys  In room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th  could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th  When we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room  When we received our bills the credit card assignments were still wrong I stay at economy hotels a lot and I have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one This hotel should do Chicago a service and just close its doors Due to this experience I will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad,positive,false
How about this had reservation confirmation in hand and still had to argue with the registration desk about price on reservation She tried to charge me price on bill they slide under your door Sorry not on my watch Then about this room you gave me I understand this place is old but for the price you charge how about some indoor plumbing You take a shower and the tub fills with water will not drain this is absolutely redickulas for this being a Hilton I think you should step back and take a look at how this place is operating Registration Fail Parking price Fail Plumbing Fail Thank you Hilton for for my super 8 experience in Chicago,positive,false
The Palmer House has a beautiful lobby with a great bar and restaurant The rooms are way too small Two people in a room with a King size bed can barely move around Not enough room for two suitcases Our room was very outdatedreminded us of the movie The Shining VERY NOISY Dont expect a quiet stay You can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbors are doing and saying not to mention everything that is happening in the hallways We requested a room change as soon as we checked in The room that we originally were in had a huge square cut out of the wall that had exposed pipes bricks dirt and dust Oh and the construction for their renovations starts at 7 am during the week We will never stay at the Palmer House again You are better off spending a few more dollars at a different hotel,positive,false
great expectations from the hotel of THE FUGITIVE Wonderful lobby AND THATS IT The room was old in style and furnitures the tv was from the other century no minibar no wireless internet no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room those guys ignore that we are in the era of IPAD without cable connections small room small bathroom rude service room they have lost my credit card number and want CASH ON DELIVERY for a breakfast of 20 dollars Robbery in the business center 059 cents a MINUTE for internet connection you have to pay to use word or excel NEVER AGAIN,positive,false
For a Hilton hotel I was very unimpressed the rooms are incredibly small there are no refrigirator or coffee machine for coffee or tea Wifi costs an arm Plus side there is a Starbucks at the bottom but only limited opening hours the lobby is very nice Location is decent,positive,false
Beautiful historic hotel  and since Im in historic building business was looking forward to stay Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up  duct work torn apart in bathroom lamp fixtures literally falling off wall mirror torn off wall etc Ended up in a room on 20th floor  much nicer but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions Only two of three elevators to top floors work  and these two elevators skip floors so you can be stuck waiting for ever When I raised this to hotel staff was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it Umm no This is not an old building problem this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it Thumbs way down stay away Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if youre looking for old world charm sans hassle,positive,false
The heating in our room didnt work and wasnt repaired depite numerous requests the rooms were very small the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay the cleaner made the bed but nothing else when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the 5 night stay despite my having prepaid through a travel agent it took the hotel 2 months to recredit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous transAtlantic phone calls to them,positive,false
