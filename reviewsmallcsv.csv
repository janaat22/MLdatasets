Well time didnt stand still per se but  lets just say that while we were in Alinea it didnt exist We were outside of time in a pocket universe all to ourselves,N
9,22,2012,0LpVTc3,TRKxLC3y-ZvP45e5iilMtw,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,0,0,5,Probably one of the best meals Ive had ever Its a performance of what food can be Having Grant Achatz prepare our dessert was amazing and getting a tour of the kitchen and prep areas downstairs by him personally was even better Be prepared for an evening and come prepared to sit for a least 4 hours or more One word to describe it = Awesome,N
9,19,2012,tljtLzf68Fkwf,0EMm8umAqXZzyhxNpL4M9g,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,0,2,3,Service was impeccable Experience and presentation was cool Eating a balloon was fun Trying to make a reservation was ridiculous Food was not mouth watering tasted like it it was made in a lab I appreciate delicious food so I dont get the hype here,N
9,6,2012,iSN,DlwexC7z88ymAzu45skODw,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,3,0,8,3,The problem with places like this given the exhorbitant cost media attention and stellar reviews is that the bar is set so high its nearly impossible to meet those expectations To set expectations the meal including wine pairing totaled 564 per person in our party of 6 Now Im no stranger to spending a lot on fine dining- The French Laundry Benu Daniel Cyrus and the Bazaar were all extravagant and decadent dining experiences Ive been fortunate to enough to try I felt each of them offered something in the way of transcendent flavors over the top service andor that little something extra to justify the value proposition All in all I felt Alinea failed to provide that value Were the dishes innovative and unique? Yes Was presentation whimsical playful and imaginative? Yes Was service attentive and informed? Yes However was the experience as a whole better than others in this class? No Was it worth it? NO Maybe this comes down to personal preference Im more a fan of precise classic plating techniques over the Jackson Pollock style presentation I found on most of the dishes here Dessert was SPOILER ALERT served by Grant Achatz himself LITERALLY shattering a filled white chocolate egg all over our nicely prepared table We were then given spoons I also had issue with the distinct lack of traditional luxury ingredients I understand the idea behind creative and non-traditional use of ingredients But for my money Id rather have a nice scoop of caviar rather than a crazy what-am-I-eating composition of discarded corn products corn silk corn smut [huitlacoche] and corn husk Indeed the waiter rather cheerfuly informed us that yes in fact we were eating trash The myriad rules and regulations were also off-putting Buy your ticket online Wear a jacket Show up 30 minutes prior to your reservation Eat this dish in 5 seconds before it decomposes in your hands Despite the whimsy of the dishes I felt that the place the whole experience simply took itself too seriously In the end Alinea will be a once in a lifetime experience for me because I simply cant justify going back,N
9,9,2012,Jmwrh7,kW2dk1CWihmh3g7k9N2G8A,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,2,1,5,I have no idea how to write my review - dining at Alinea brings a whole different perspective to food life and Chicago I think everyone has a unique experience with the food - ingredients and presentation - but two things Ill highlight about my personal experience are 1 This was an amazingly vegetarian friendly place for the experience After youve bought a ticket theyll call to ask a few days ahead of the reservation about any dietary restrictions and thats when they record vegetarian I didnt feel that we missed out on even an ounce of the experience that non-vegetarians have in fact I admire the kitchens ability to do such a great job with it 2 this place is very unique and of course expensive but not a single staff member here was pretentious or stiff - they took a lot of pride in what they do but in a natural friendly way the American way as my dining partner put it You can be comfortable natural and just enjoy,N

Then Ill continue Should you choose to do wine pairings with each course which I strongly recommend the sommelier will pour you a smorgasbord of varietals including a few youve probably never heard of before ie Zibibbo With each pour there will be an accompanying story about where the wine came from and why the flavors within make it the perfect pairing Overall Grant Achatzs progressive style of cuisine is pure genius and the experience is joyous and genuinely enchanting For better or worse I guarantee you will leave with a new perspective on the unbounded future of the culinary arts I hope to someday return to Chicago and do it all over again Counsel Like Alineas Facebook page for up-to-date information on when new reservations will be released same-day dining options and upcoming projects such as their forthcoming collaboration with New Yorks Eleven Madison Park,N
9,8,2012,PBS2uyee9V5IpFfTropxbw,OW2H-GkKnlVEBPuGHIaiFg,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,0,1,5,Overall was it worth the hype? Yes and more Was it worth every penny? Hell yes Is it a life changing food experience? Yes Will I be coming back? You bet Soon? Probably not it definitely broke the bank and Id also like to see a different menu Truly 5-star experience I was able to snag a 2-top ticket from their new ticketing system which isnt hard to obtain as long as you follow them on Facebook or twitter and you check fairly regularly The meal at the end of the day ran me nearly 1000 which I will say without hesitation was the best 1000 Ive ever spent Everything from the food wine pairing service sort of atmosphere was everything you paid for and more They only have a prix-fixe menu of 15-17 items mostly all of them were excellent They all emphasized the pure flavors of the ingredients such as the corn as well as the tomato both fantastic and one our favorites Other courses emphasized the subtleties and complementary flavors such as the chanterelle probably our favorite of the evening Other items were shock and awe like the lamb with 52 different complementary ingredients which was fun and interactive good but by far not the best dish and the apple balloon with edible string by far the most fun dish Other courses emphasized a whole new experience like the black truffle explosion and the white chocolate dessert made table-side by the chef Even after 2-plus weeks after eating there there were a lot of items that I still remember every aspect this was truly a life-changing meal Other aspects of the restaurant like the decor itself was nice and dimly lit The service overall was flawless but some of the staff was not very friendly and a little stuck-up Our main server however was fairly interactive and friendly The kitchen tour was amazing as well spotless and got a chance to do one of our courses prepared on the spot Though we did not get to meet Chef Achatz his current chef there was friendly articulate and still producing magnificent food I would certainly like to see him open his own restaurant in the future If you made it this far in my review and probably others just do yourself a favor and just grab a ticket and a date and eat here You wont regret it One additional note here After eating at Charlie Trotters about a month before and paying nearly 500 per person with wine Trotters didnt come anywhere near to what Alinea produced in terms of experience and food Although the wine pairings there were superior,N
8,24,2012,PkwbB,BSh3h1J4mdSmEsb8FFdf0Q,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,0,8,3,There are already TONS of professional  amateur reviews of Alinea you can read through them if you want to get into the details Ill spend my time here throwing out some general impressions in no particular order Enjoy - Book buy tickets way way way in advance This place is booked for at least two months out - Mental prep - dont over-hype this place before your first visit Like most other fine dining restaurants this place is very very good However if you keep thinking this is supposed to be the 1 rated restaurant in the US youre likely to leave disappointed like my wife and I - Dinner for the 6 of us took over 6 hours to complete Make sure you go with fun good company Even for couplesits hard to have a 3-hour dinner togetherwe saw many bored couples that didnt talk - Dress nice Real nice nuff said - Dont go cheap here If you are already spending this much on dinner might as well get the wine pairing if you like to drink different kinds of wine Or if youre like us and dont drink that much just get a bottle Expect to spend about 800 - 1000 for two people - The food profiles are innovative and presentation was visually stunning It takes a true genise to come up with each course However my wife and I were only knock our socks off wowed by just a few courses We particularly liked the razor clams crab and mushrooms served on heated stones - Service - its nice but less formal  attentive than what I would expect at a place like this Not that we enjoy a place that is super formal and stuffy but it felt a bit too casual for us - We also would have appreciated a bit more explanation of what we are eating before each course Our waiter just didnt know or wanted to spend the time to explain In fact it was a bit annoying that he wants us to guess what we were eating Really annoying now that I think about it again We paid good money to eat there show an effort to explain things - Just to be clear none of the courses tasted bad We were just looking to be wowed by each courseand it didnt happen - Dessert - while seeing them prepare it in front of us was cool it really wasnt that complex and the taste was a bit disappointing - Valet - its only 11 do it Its a nice touch that they already have the car pulled up front waiting for you by the time you walk out the door,N

8,23,2012,z-j4X,NvSnBp4fTpNOfDwm2GWusA,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,0,3,5,Lots of complaints about how difficult it is to get in and I get it its hard But I can promise you that it is worth it This is dining as performance art And that is not to say that the food takes a backseat to the show The theatricality of the presentations perfectly honors the beauty of the meal To go over the details would be to give away too many surprises but we had a fantastic time You are treated like a VIP from the moment you walk up to the unmarked door But this VIP treatment also has a wonderful comfortableness about it It doesnt feel stuffy We ended up chatting with the table next to us because it was just too fun You get the sense that they are encouraging the playfulness to go along with the fun they obviously had coming up with the amazing experience Do whatever you have to to get in here Its a meal and and experience that you wont soon forget,N

9,11,2012,V0PU0ciEBeNiHHS1,-3Mzc2O6jmYLWQJcIJdvAA,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,1,1,5,Today marks one year since my dinner at Alinea It was the finest dining experience of my life and it lived up to all of my lofty expectations In hindsight it is not the culinary party tricks or the use of technology that still lingers in the forefront of my mind although each innovative technique employed delighted me and served to advance each dish My memories fall back on the bright harmonious flavors and the impeccable at at times playful service To borrow from Michelins own rubric Alinea provided me exceptional cuisine worth a special journey So much so that I I cannot imagine another trip to Chicago without partaking of what ever joys that Achatz may have in store,N
8,16,2012,revID_update_res1,Or40sZeUkVa2w1SCjhaUVg,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,1,3,5,In my four years as a member of Yelp Ive written a grand total of two - count em TWO - restaurant reviews As much as I consider myself a foodie Im just not big on writing about food And even though Ive had the pleasure of collecting over 20 Michelin stars from dining standards like Wolfgang Pucks Spago to bucket-list restaurants like Thomas Kellers The French Laundry and Per Se over the past few years Ive never really felt compelled to write a review about any of them Then I dined at Alinea Grant Achatzs Michelin three-starred restaurant in Chicago at the forefront of American molecular gastronomy FOOD First things first at Alinea unlike the aforementioned The French Laundry and Per Se food is as much about spectacle as it is about taste The plating and presentation of the dishes here were by far the most creative Ive ever experienced A few were gimmicky eg four pieces of seafood entangled in seaweed atop a giant piece of driftwood but most were functional - and all were extremely fun especially the green apple balloon and the cracked white chocolate egg Now if youre worried that Chef Achatz is all style and no substance - as I was - let me reassure you some of his dishes were among the best Ive ever eaten The aforementioned four pieces of seafood were the best bites of crab lobster and clam Ive ever had the corn dish was out of this world and you cant go wrong with two of Chef Achatzs signature dishes Hot Potato Cold Potato and Black Truffle Explosion My sister and I also went to town on the final dessert the cracked white chocolate egg that covered the entire table and finished the entire thing which was no easy feat considering it was the 19th and final course - and also the largest SERVICE Like any Michelin-starred restaurant the service here is top-notch - dishes always arrived with razor-like synchronicity every course was explained thoroughly crumbs were always brushed away and my wine glass was never left empty If I have one complaint its that I felt the service here was a bit more relaxed than what Ive experienced at Thomas Kellers restaurants or at Joel Robuchons three Tokyo establishments The servers were always professional but they had a more casual attitude than what Im used to at restaurants of this caliber Some people dont like the stuffy atmosphere of fine dining restaurants but if Im gonna pay an arm and a leg for a meal fit for a king I dont mind being treated like one AMBIANCE Other than the darkened entrance hall with its neon outlines and grassy walkway I was not particularly impressed by the decor of the restaurant - its mainly black and white with accent lighting in various shades of neon But I think thats kind of the point Each of the food presentations here is like its own work of art so the restaurant itself is like the blank canvas upon which these works of art are presented Nowhere was this more obvious than during the cracked white chocolate egg dessert course which utilized the entire table - covered with a latex tablecloth of course - as a canvas I will say though that the noise level in the restaurant was a bit on the louder end which again created a more casual atmosphere than what Im used to at Michelin-starred restaurants VERDICT Im not an easily impressed diner and I dont like writing food reviews But Alinea surpassed all of my expectations and then some and my dining experience here prompted me to do the unthinkable to write a review on Yelp And thats just it - you dont just have dinner at Alinea you have a DINING EXPERIENCE One that I will never forget,N

9,15,2012,Hk9BR0a,EkItn2a_Fx1KE9Q5amo7JA,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,0,0,5,I dined at Alinea a few weeks ago with my son for his 25th birthday He was quite excited to have scored tickets with their new ticketing system and on his birthday nonetheless I had heard of Alinea a few years ago when they first opened and wondered what it was all about My impression before going there was too expensive  weird food Couldnt imagine eating that many courses Well what an amazing experience I could only compare it to Charlie Trotters where I dined a few months back This blows Charlies away Sorry Charlie The restaurant doesnt have a sign out in front liked that  a nice young man greeted us  we entered The hallway floor was real grass--real grass with a small set up with fresh lemonade We were then led to our table The restaurant has no music playing  is fairly modern but simple They ask about allergies wine pairings etc and the experience begins  I wont go into detail on every course as there were simply too many  I frankly couldnt remember what they consisted of But there was a seafood course served on a piece of driftwood that was to die for Also a mushroom dish on hot stones that was amazing as well A summer salad of some sort with everything fresh delicious  I can only remember disliking one dish  the little pieces of ginger they served on these little skewer things was just okay The hot potatocold potato  truffle explosion that I had heard of famously were also just amazing  The service was excellent and the waiters each one nicer than the next The courses were spaced apart nicely but not too far apart or close together  They brought my son a special chocolate desert for his birthday compliments of the staff which was really nice and no singing happy birthday The desert was amazing  then we had the privilege of having Chef Achatz serve us the famous white chocolate pinata himself My son was awestruck  the expression on his face was priceless--well worth the price of the meal  So was this worth it? It most definitely was Years back I could never have imagined spending that much money on a meal But the way I look at it many people spend comparable amounts on dinner  a concert dinner  movie drinks out a night at the opera or theter whatever it is you like--cigarettes Starbucks etc This was a magical night with my son  one we will always remembercant put a price on that,N

Let me answer that- IT IS I could tell how every bite of every course was one of the best most interesting most surprising things I have ever eaten and how it has changed how I experience food and dining I could tell you that the wine pairings were spectacular and pushed each course to yet another level I could tell you that I was a little starstruck by Grant Achatz and wished Id snuck in a photo of him creating the final course tableside for people close to us if I hadnt being playing it I totally belong here cool and trying to keep the delivery of that course a surprise  I could also tell you that the service was formal but personable enough that when we had a hands free course that I was comfy enough to raise mine up ala on a rollercoaster or look ma no hands   I could tell you all of those thingsbut the fact that I was mid-dinner scheming how I could save up to come again soon may be all you need to hear from me,N

Im certainly no expert at doing this and definitely made some suboptimal choices And do people really like the dessert where they drop things everywhere? Its a cool show but taste-wise it was pretty far from the best desserts Ive had I have to give it 4s because a few of the courses were among the best dishes Ive ever had in terms of taste and presentation Some of my favorites without going into too much detail for fear of ruining it for others included an otoro course and a lobstercrab dish Just know what your getting yourself into its much hype not everything will be even close to the best things youve ever tasted there wont be as much meatseafood as courses at other restaurants one course was only ginger the reservation system where you buy your table in advance with no ability to change it at all is highly obnoxious and shows how pretentious these people are no other top restaurants in the country do this But the presentation of the food was by far the best Ive ever experienced So there are some things to cheer about,N

Not at all Turns out this is a heck of a popular place so without much fuss we were able to find a fourth to join us on our culinary adventure Concerns about the awkwardness of spending 4 hours with a stranger were entirely unfounded Its amazing how shared admiration for breathtaking food can bring people together At a price tag of 280 sans drinks this place had a lot to live up to I am very happy to report that I think it was worth every penny While there are plenty of fine dining establishments providing you with fine culinary fare Alinea is providing you with a complete experience Dinner and a show I was surprised by the extent to which the restaurant made use of molecular gastronomy but the bells and whistles added rather than detracted every time Innovative techniques and ingredients came together in surprising and wonderful ways I wont provide any details of how I wouldnt want to ruin the surprise Just go and be prepared to have your mind blown,N

4,19,2012,-Ki9dxI2dKR57bucOxpaZA,OQjwZuE5xNJvbNoVl3zcgg,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,5,2,3,5,[For the full review with pictures see the link to my blog on my profile] I thought my plan was foolproof two months to the calender day as soon as 11am Eastern Time struck I would call Alinea and presumably have no problem securing a reservation Well I was under a misapprehension It ultimately took 3-5 phone calls per minute for 95 minutes before I finally made it through to a reservationist I hated the restaurant before I had even crossed the border into Illinois During my final class of the semester when the subject of Chicago restaurants surfaced one of my stats professors mentioned that Alinea delivered the best meal of his life I found myself struggling to agree with him Its not the best meal Ive had I said nor is it the tastiest food Ive ever had But it doesnt need to be because its the most fun Ive ever had in a restaurant tout court Alineas impishness is on display from the moment one is seated as the tables centerpiece is a large block of ice gravid with beet-hibiscus-black licorice juice that becomes a palate cleanser following an aggressively seasoned pure of scallops--intended to mirror tofu except with flavor of course--sitting in inter alia dashi With one playful dish after another the occasional pratfall is bound to occur And it did several times Nothing fell flatter than a utensil-free course of Mangalitsa ham squid tentacle orange and fennel which tasted as if the kitchen had discovered a way to transmogrify orange into a dogs chew toy making for one of the more unpleasant adventures of the evening And then there was the edible helium-filled green apple taffy balloon The balloon is temperature sensitive and due to the moderate humidity that day on first delivery one of the balloons shriveled into an unattractive mass at which point a collective dejection cascaded across the dining room based on the runners reaction and how quickly he absconded back to the kitchen you would have thought he arrived with his pants down Those lapses can be easily overlooked given the deep-water greatness of several items After a few introductory courses that amount to throat-clearing exercises the kitchen demonstrated its ability to walk on water with four courses of outright genius that detonate on your palate unlike anything youve experienced before It started with a mouthful of spring four torrid stones holding first of the season morels coated in the feathery baste of beurre mont asparagus maitakes mushroom pure fried mizuna and a sixty-three degree quail egg Next wed be treated to an Achatz original hot potato-cold potato which leaves your brain trying to conduct an expeditious inventory of details--hot black truffle-topped Yukon gold potato check cold velvety potato soup check--as it reconciles two seemingly incongruous sensations Moving on to what would constitute the main course first a mirror with sixty ingredients was placed in the middle of the table soon followed by a plate with three immaculately prepared cuts of lamb the shank the saddle and the loin This almost seemed like the kitchens way of saying Hey just in case you thought all we do is play around with gels hydrocolloids and unconventional plating techniques check this s out Spacing out the classics then came the black truffle explosion Achatzs successful effort that lasers in on the flavor of black truffle As if it had been read a sob story the raviolo gushed forth its black truffle goodness And despite instructions to seal ones lips tightly I managed to spray truffle stock half-way across the table Overseeing this playground was our server Kevin a hirsute redhead I had read that service could be on the cold and condescending side but that certainly wasnt our experience for everyone who made a pit stop at our table was delightful and most courteous My one gripe is that while a meal at Alinea will leave one giddy theres also fatigue that comes with two-and-a-half hours of instructions that precede each course--dont grab the burning end of the cinnamon stick dont bite down on the metal ball please dont wait too long to enjoy this dish as it is time sensitive and on it goes--such that there are points where one wonders Is this a restaurant or am I in the principals office? One final point it seemed to me that tables were a bit too close to one another This wouldnt be such a problem if menu length varied by table as it did several years ago when the restaurant offered a 26-course option However since every table now experiences the same sequence of courses theres a reasonably high probability that many of the surprises can be sullied if you find yourself gazing in any direction for too long Notwithstanding these minor quibbles the food is stunning Its the equivalent of running a red light over a dozen times and not crashing and I cannot wait to return the next chance I get,N

You will never use the same utensils twice When I left to use the restroom I threw my napkin on the table I came back to find my napkin folded neatly When there was a drop of sauce on my table the waiter came right away to wipe it up for me  The food was creative and so artistic You almost dont want to eat it because it looked so beautiful I didnt even know some was edible My camera phone was snapping shots all night The thing here is about quality not quantity So if you are looking for 20 oz steaks dont come The food will tickle your 5 senses smellsighttouchtasteand hearing If you get the wine pairing like I did Then make that 6 mind Yes I got pretty buzzed after 15-1 oz glasses of wine Remember this is 19 courses so expect to be there for 3 hours I dont want to give the description of the food away but its nothing youll find elsewhere Very molecular gastronomy I would say Some food were playful while others were a deconstruction of a classic dish And does it taste good? Hell Yes I gave this place 4 stars because I did think it was a little expensive But if you want that once in a lifetime experience then come to Alinea Its worth it Lucky getting a reservation though generally its a 3 month wait,N

Yes it was hands down the most incredible memorable once in a life time food experience I have ever had They were very accomodating to my poultry onlyvegetarianism ways The restaurant is gorgeous the staff bend over backwards for you  except the sommelier hes an obnoxious as but from my experiences most are and there seems to be a surprise at every course My advice go in with an open mind and think of it as youre going to the theater relax and enjoy Am I running back? No but not because it wasnt fantastic but because Ill give it a few years for the chef to come up with some new tricks It wouldnt be as fun with out the element of surprise If you havent been dont let your friends ruin it for you by telling you what to expect ahead of time,N

Heres the problem for me with reviewing Alinea It was probably the most amazing dining experience Ive ever had and strangely personal You can read 5000 reviews detailing the food Im not going to do that here but you really need to experience it first hand What I will say is- from when you walk down that hallway and pause before that sliding door to when you hand the valet your ticket for your car to go home- you will have had the most unique experience that is worth every penny Service- exemplary We thought for sure the servers were going to be stuffy and all pip-pip But they were funny and knowledgable Smartly dressed We were there a good 4 hours and laughed the whole time Why is everyone so quiet? Why is there no soft music? I dont know and frankly it doesnt matter Food- not only did I taste things that blew my mind but VISUALLY things blew me away It was like eating art and performance artyes its possible I loved getting a copy of the menu at the end of the meal Wine- hmmm beware of the wine pairing While delicious there is a lot of it LOTS Okay fine I had to start giving mine away Sooo save save saves GO If you feel about food the way I do- it will be life changing,N

When did the thought putting a pillow of pine-scented air on my table with a beautiful bowl enter his mind? The wine was wondrous Please dont indulge without it It should not be an optional component This interface with the meal was critical to my understanding of the dish as well as my propensity of getting more later on in the evening thanks Grant I can easily close this review by writing a clich that each true foodie should experience the wonder that is Alinea What I recommend is hell Go - spend the money I can promise you wont be disappointed,N

No way brutha youll just have to experience it yourself I will say you MUST fast before the tasting I can stuff myself but this meal is not easy    To end our night around 130 am Achatz came out to our table  only ours  painted our table top with a gorgeous edible work of art Then with a slight look of insanity he lifted a volleyball sized ball of freshly made chocolate and slammed it on the table It shattered and like a pinata freshly prepared desert candy came out cotton candy ect It was a delicious work of art that and  thanks to the volume of wine  looked like a drug deal gone bad An abstract depiction with raspberry syrup splattered like blood some stuff that looked like cocaine and enough pink and purple that gave it a post New Years South Beach VIP lounge appearance,N

What separates Alinea from other restaurants of this caliber is the uniqueness in the food and preparation Pure genious,N

Then the English peas three ways When this bowl arrived it was hot and cold all at once You start with the top Then open it up to find the freeze dried stuff with olive oil blobs and grapes Then remove that section to discover a silky-smooth puree Unlike any pea soup Ive ever had I got quite excited for the next course when the marked our table with a pair of scissors I knew I was going to get to snip away at that center piece I was right We added the baby chard mizuna thai basil cilantro and more to our tomato heaven It was like eating soup and salad at the same time The flavor of the broth alone may have taken the cake for my fave course and then add the fact that I get to play with my food by adding LIVE lettuces and herbs snipped from our own table garden? Whaaaaa? This is what they like to call hands-free dining Its one little bite on a skewer that you simply remove with your mouth Yeah Fun Less important were the ingredients Mackerel mango bergamot flower and who knows what else Then a little mushroom garden with a cream infused with pine yes pine as in cone and a bunch of other interesting ingredients I think they were going for a forest-in-your-mouth sensation Success Oh And then there was hot potato cold potato A warm creamy potato soup with a mini cold potato on which a slice of black truffle rested There was also a little cube of butter and parm on the mini skewer which melted into the soup upon removing the skewer from its resting place All carefully dropped into the soup which was then gulped from the little bowl This one was fun too Heres the fanciest little lamb dish youll ever see I cant tell you all of the components but I can tell you that this was one to merit the chair dance Wonderful A favorite at the table and amongst Achatz followers was the Truffle Explosion A one bite raviolo filled with juicy truffle heaven It rested on a spoon that sat in a bowl that had no bottom Yes a bowl built only to hold a spoon The garnish is a tiny romaine leaf black truffle and shaved parm Ridiculously delicious Heres a whacky one First remove the glass plate containing a bunch of little garnishes like blackberry fermented garlic and olives from its base Then construct a devise with the tools provided on which to hang the pasta that was somehow snuck to your table in the form of a second center piece Fill the pasta with decadent braised short ribs and strange garnishes of your choosing before wrapping it up and eating it like a taco See I told you it was whacky You can barely see the little octopus tentacle resting next to a smooth set eggplant puree with coriander and more Take the bite then wash it down with the frothiness in the bowl This was the intermezzo to clear the palatte Coconut snow with yuzu Just dont lick it directly from the frozen metal or youll end up like Ralphy from A Christmas Story Ouch I loved this course too All kinds of crazy stuff that a normal person would never pair There were squares of peach puree basil balsamic jasmine mozzarella creme fraiche I was like a kid in a candy store I had so much fun mixing and matching flavors and textures Full review on blog,N

Yes the waitstaff is super knowledgeable at Fl which makes the service slightly better if you get a laugh out of the formalness as L and I do We were there until 230 but not the last table Grant was not there because he was getting a James Beard award The kichen is spotless The wine list is not as priced as nigh as French Laundry  It was a memorable night to be at the 7 restaurant in the world Well worth it Funny to me how those in Chicago may not even know of Alinea,N

Afterwards sip on the consomm made from the rich broth that soaked the cinnamon stick Unfortunately I thought this was a little salty for my liking A smoky aroma filled the room it was from the burning fig that held the PHEASANT TEMPURA with walnuts together Light crunch very unique and the pheasant was very tender but Im not a big fan of walnuts One of the most interesting dish was the create-your-own SHORT-RIB RAVIOLI with a variety ingredients of your choice Including sea salt olives blackberry onion etc I made sure to put everything in my wrap It was delicious and the chilled pasta wrap was warmed by the slow braised short rib The creativity and hands on experience does not end here Next up was a shot of temperature sensitive POTATO with black truffle Warm truffle paired with icy cold potato and mushroom What a scrumptious sensation Then our server poured us a GRAPE SODA to match with the extremely tender PIGEONNEAU on a light puff pastry BLACK TRUFFLE EXPLOSION blew up in my mouth Keep your lips shut for this as you dont want luscious rich truffle spilling out of your lips Cheesy creamy truffle MMM A spoonful was delectable and satisfying To pave the way to desserts an unusual sweet-savory set of three came A PINEAPPLE SUGAR SHEET dusted with ham flavoured powder Be sure to eat it with the powder facing up and youll keep the table powder-free Slightly sugary more savory A crispy bacon glazed with butterscotch and a cup of liquefied caramel popcorn made a sweet drink An exquisite transition from main course to dessert An inflated pillow infused with earl grey permeated the room while we cut up EARL GREY COOKIE topped with white chocolate and crunchy strips My favourite dessert is the tube of bubble gum flavoured CREME FRAICHE Jelly like in the tube suck it out and all three layers combined A chewy consistency of mini tapioca balls and fruity-bubblegum flavoured Ending the night was the full blown dessert a CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM frozen by liquid nitrogen Surrounded by huckleberries nougat and a dollop of vanilla cream The crisp sheet decorating the final piece stood out from the soft and cooling ice cream Service was impeccable Napkins replaced water droplets and crumbs wiped off each course explained thoroughly and came and left in a syncronised fashion gracefully and efficiently  Tip Business formal dress code suggested We made reservations at least a month in advance Cancellation costs 100 per person Tasting menu was not that filling but still left me about 80 full I liked being there at 5pm because we were the first ones to get seated and we were the first ones to get our food Favourites Very friendly service not pretentious at all Expensive but not disgustingly unaffordable Do not want I wanted a little more red meat =p Last words What an EXPERIENCE,N

Okay so tickets were booked for Chicago and I called one month in advance to make reservations at Alinea I got a busy signal for 2 hours straight but I finally got through and reservations were made Success Okay my party and I got here and nearly missed this place The outside looked like some type of garage until we saw a small folding sign on the ground that says Alinea Bingo We were taken to our seats We were the first ones to arrive and it felt really awkward at first because there were so many servers around and they were looking at us My party didnt really talk much because it would echo off the walls since it was that quiet After 10-15 minutes more diners showed upphew the awkwardness was gone So here is the dinner in a brief summary -Very interesting nothing I have experienced before -Assembling was needed in some dishes -Everything was delicious -Loved the concept -Nifty plating techniques -Delicious foamyes foam with taste -Took a shot of the aquarium and had a leaf stuck in my windpipehaha that wasnt fun -The glasses were never half full -Explosionwow that was something wished there were more of those -The waitstaff warned us on some foods not to eat with mouth open or it would end up on ourselves or the person across from us I wonder if anyone really got food on others -We were also warned not to lick this ice cold lid-thing because apparently someone in the past done it and their tongue got stuck - at least his tongue was stuck to something yummy -The dessert was AMAZING it was beautifully put together by Chef Grant Achatz himself So how was the experience? Definitely worth hopping on a plane for and planning everything around this 45 hour dinner for Every dish was like Christmas because you dont know what is going to come out next And as for me I was like a kid who couldnt wait until Christmas to open my presents - that I broke the rules and opened lids and such when they told me not to I still remember one of the waitstaff said to me You just couldnt have waited 20 seconds huh? Haha The whole experience was very interesting and fun The servers were really friendly and funny which I thought they wouldve been more uptight because of how fancy this place was My party and I had a great time here Yours truly A gal with an appetite who will travel for food PS - they are vegetarian friendly too PPS - Ive uploaded pictures without captions because I dont want to spoil any surprises PPPS - Hut hut If you hear something that sounds like a football game huddle in the kitchen its just Cheft Achatz think of him as the quarterback and his team making your dinner PPPPS - Now youre done reading this review what are you waiting for?

Dining at Alinea is a bit like a trip to Vegas Yes I had a blast but since leaving the restaurant I have felt a pervasive sense of guilt from dropping a small fortune on dinner for two Yes we were celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary and you only live once a life motto that usually guides my principles but fair warning eating here will or at least should mess with your conscience,N

OMG Yes But also delightfully fun creative delicious interesting experimental and unexpected Alinea was an amazing dining experience Everything about it from walking into an unmarked door to the service to the food was all impeccable This is a food experience unlike anything I have ever tried Most of the dishes were wonderful and complex Not everything worked and tasted great But you sort of understand what they were trying to accomplish even if the result wasnt perfected Each dish was served on some gadget out of Alton Browns kitchen They had pins knifes wires pillows and all types of strange contraptions One memorable dish was the Hot Potato cold potato soup black truffle butter The almost overpowering truffle in this cold soup really blended so well with the potato It brought the main ingredients to the forefront and I had wished more of the touring menu was like this The Rhubarb ginger basil course was really unexpected It was a candy ball containing sweet and refreshing rhubarb and basil juice The ball created an intense flavor explosion in your mouth Some dishes that I didnt think work as well was the Wagyu Beef This was brought out frozen and pinned to a stand to let defrost over several courses The Wagyu was sliced so thinly for it to defrost properly it was difficult to taste the wonderful fatty meat The Dry shot pineapple rum cilantro was served in powdered form in a paper envelope and youre supposed to empty the packet in your mouth It created a pina colada shot but the powders didnt mix well so you are left with a dry clump It was definitely creative but not so tasty Maybe it was because we did the five hour 25 course touring menu and it was around 1 oclock in the morning at that point But when we got to the desserts they did not live up to the other courses This was really a once in a lifetime experience for me I dont think I would do the 25 course menu again but absolutely the smaller tasting menu,N

First of all the menu at Alinea is a secret - you dont get to see it beforehand This means that each course is a big adventure although they do ask you beforehand if theres anything youre allergic to so they dont inadvertently kill you Next each course is interactive Instead of just passively sitting there while each dish is placed before you and then using the usual boring knife and fork you actually have to DO different things to enjoy each course There are courses that you eat with your fingers tidbits of food on a skewer where you have to lean forward and bite it off fresh greens growing in a centerpiece of real soil which you harvest for your salad yourself by snipping them off with manicure scissors liquid courses that you suck out of a tube dishes that come apart and have to be assembled a certain way before you can combine the different ingredients to complete the entre  Then there are all the surprising blends of different flavors salty steelhead roe eggs with sweet watermelon mousse hamachi deep-fried with banana and ginger a cheese-flavored ravioli with a liquid center of black truffle chocolate with red pepper sauce The creativity attention to detail and formal presentation devoted to each dish is incredible Our dessert was literally a work of art which was created right in front of us -- by head chef Grant Achatz himself we later found out -- before we were allowed to eat it by scraping it off the surface of the table which had been covered with a practical rubber tablecloth beforehand Ive never been so tempted to take a picture of my food which I thought was something only tourists do but I was too eager to dive in and start eating In most high-end restaurants you feel as if you have to mind your table manners Here its perfectly acceptable to lick your fingers although they do provide hot towels for the especially messy finger foods and otherwise enjoy yourself If you like wine Alinea prides itself on its wine list but better to go with the optional wine pairing where each course is perfectly complimented by a specially selected wine Arrive hungry - the portions are tiny but after a total of 16 or so courses we lost count youll be more than satisfied Also save a visit here for special occasions because its definitely pricey - but do go at least once Its definitely worth the three-star Michelin rating Have fun,N

Great Its located in a building thats pretty nondescript During the day my friend described it asshady looking In the evening there will be a tiny sign for Valet Service 11 Unless youre lucky and theres a spot open why not just Valet Youre already splurging on this epic meal Oh yeaformal jackets requireddont be a bum The interior looks like an upscale office Tell them your name and reservation time and off you go to your seats Theyll take your valet card so they can prep your car when your meal is ending or call you a cab if thats the route you went Service They only do wines so dont expect cocktails Wine pairings ranged from 160 to 250 Ok Food Warning that there will be some spoilers Steelhead Roe sitting on a bed of watermelon mousse wrapped in watermelon flesh and finished off with watermelon consume poured in with an edible flower Wonderful starter that was mostly sweet but light elements of savory Hamachi bite that had pineapple salt ginger west indie spices and kaffir lime with Vanilla Bean Stick for holder Complex flavors here It was sweet but also sour from the kaffir then salty and rich from the hamachi Another good opening to get your tastebuds going At this point they brought out what looked like fruit rollups and set them down and told us wed deal with them laterintrigue The next dish was a quad that we were supposed to eat in a specific order The presentation was these 4 shellfish sitting on kelp sitting on this driftwood Oyster Leaf topped with a mignonette Leaves that taste like oysters Taylor Bay Scallop with old bay oil and a white ale foam One of the highlight bites of the night The scallop was juicy and firm and had an overall richness of flavor Top Neck Clam with an xo sauce and carrot and ginger tapiocas This reminded me of Asian cuisine with the xo sauce and the salty flavors Mussel with saffron chorizo and orange The mussel was sitting in the shell and the other flavors were these cubes that sat on top of it so as you chewed the flavors got intense based on which cube you were hitting Yuba tofu skin with shrimp and a miso mayo dip They dried it rolled it up and deep fried it to create a stick then wrapped a shrimp around it and placed it in a holder that had a well of miso mayo dipping sauce Chip and dip Mackerel bite with juniper radish flower and mango We were just to chomp down and slide the bite off the wire Great layers to the flavors Salty richness from the mackeral moving down to the sweet mango Wild Mushrooms dish A mixture of wild mushrooms with sumac pine and ramps The mushrooms individually had great earthy flavors but it didnt come together as a whole for me Hot Potato cold potato black truffle butterone of the winners of the night Small wax bowl with a wire in it that has a potato sphere with a black truffle cap a cube of butter and a cube of something else You pull the wire out so everything falls in and then take the whole bite Wow great bite Lamb Loin with lamb jous reduction and barnaise along with mini potato spheres There were 2 small lamb loin medallions topped with a slice of artichoke heart and 2 small asparagus tips This sat on a crunchy flaky disc On the center and sides were the jous and sauce to dip in Short Rib olive fermented garlic fresh blackberry smoked salt white wine radish tobacco agarthis is where those flags come in play Make your own wrap with all this stuff Also you get to make the holder for the tomato pasta and the engineer in me got happy Black Truffle explosion Winner Single bit of ravioli with liquid truffle insidethat is all Octopus with eggplant mousse and soup Also great the mousse was awesome Yuzu Snow Palette cleanser Sprayed yuzu mist over a super cold dish to create snow You scrape to create a granita Refreshing Peach jasmine basil balsamic mozzarella cubes Think caprese salad Basil cubes and mozzarella ice cream were win Lemongrass juice dragonfruit and herbs A tube where you sucked down this refreshing liquid Chocolate mousse red pepper bitter orange banana rum brulee and rum cake The chefs came out to create this art on the table for us The mousse was frozen in liquid nitro Lots of fun to watch and eat Servers were warm funny joked with us It was awesome They told us we were sitting at Zac Efrons table but were more fun Our sommelier was passionate knowledgeable and talked like a motorboat Running out of chars So TRY IT,N

My friends and colleagues probably still think Im insane But you know what? It was one of the best experiences of my life If you have the time and resources I highly recommend a trip to Alinea  Just some personal notes before you do so I wont really go into the food because I think plenty has been said about how amazing and creative it all is Also theres not much else to say about the service except that it was impeccable and not stuffy or pretentious at all It truly was as good as it gets  250 redials sound ridiculous but that was because we had a short window in which we were in Chicago namely two nightsand it was summer time If you wanted to dine on a Wednesday during a bad weather monthprobably wont be as much effort  I agree with Valerie H- dining at Senior Citizen time is actually a good thing because you get to see your dishes come out first as there is only one menu Howeverits not a big deal to just revert your eyes if you dine later We actually had a 545 rez and some folks were there before us so we just made an effort to not look over at their table I highly recommend reading Chef Achatzs book Life on the Line A Chefs Story of Chasing Greatness Facing Death and Redefining the Way We Eat before you dine at Alinea SImply one of the best non-fiction pieces Ive ever read I made my husband and our 3rd dining companion a high school buddy of mine read this before our meal and they agreed with me that the book enhanced the experience even more Wear something dressy but also comfortable We were there for nearly 4 hours I think The thing I appreciated about Alinea was the pacing and amount of food We werent so stuffed by the end that we couldnt enjoy our dessert The portions were just right throughout the meal and when we left we felt satisfied but not so full that it hurt to walk What was my favorite course?

No Is is the most creative?

When each course came out I felt a little rude taking photos of EVERYTHING but I didnt want to miss anything Make sure you make your reservations on the first when the books open for the month 2 months prior Id double check,N

Every dish was subpar because although it was elegantly presented the flavors clashed the play on traditional cooking did not work out and half of the time the waiters didnt bother to even tell us how to eat it If you make it complicated with no instructions perhaps were not enjoying it correctly? In the end even the main dish the steak I had high expectations but mine was cold and the bfs was warm hence ours were differently cooked thus did not taste the same even though we both opted for medium rare When I got the bill I just felt unsatisfied Ive been to restaurants fancier and pricier Ive been to other 3 Michelin stars and some 2 Michelin stars that deserve one more but the food here did not do it for me especially with all the confusion The service was terrible who argues with a guest and makes a scene in front of other guests? And the whole evening was stiffly subpar and awkward after the experience Ugh Will not be back Will be heading to L2O this time,N

Food at its simplest is a means of sustenance but most chefs aspire to something greater than that - an experience a revelation a burst of emotion In the moment that experience is mostly pleasure and sensation Later long after the meal has been consumed only memory remains Herein lies the problem my memory of Alinea will almost always be tainted Without written or visual aids I have only a vague recollection of the subtleties of flavor smell and texture I remember - in the abstract sense - the meal being technically and aesthetically brilliant but the overwhelming emotion is one of disappointment The initial adrenaline rush of meeting Chef Achatz is gone elation over discovering new flavor combinations somewhat muted and what was a merely frustrating 5-minute interaction has now evolved into a dark cloud hanging over the memory of an otherwise delicious meal The human mind has a tendency to become more fixed over time opinions are stronger less subject to shades of gray A few sentences of somewhat patronizing preamble to the meal can have outsized impact in the long run that not even the talents of Achatzs team can counteract Ill return one day still a lightweight but not quite so young I wonder if I will be treated differently I hope that in the meantime Alinea will learn not to judge a book by its cover,N

Only because it somehow raises my credibility during conversation when I note that Ive eaten there - and thats not my modus operandi If youre a foodie with the budget that would allow you to indulge in a 3-star Michelin restaurant then undoubtedly you will be extremely satisfied with your decision to dine at Alinea But if youre a casual diner who enjoys great food and pleasurable dining experiences youll likely be be left wondering how you ever thought it would be okay to pay this much for 21 courses of food you probably wont be able to describe without a photo to back up your explanation of such things as a crisp of reconstituted pineapple juice dusted with bacon One might say that casual diners lack the sophisticated palate of a true foodie which may be true But one might also say that you can have outstanding dining experiences for 16 of the cost put another way with the astounding number of excellent dining options in Chicago you can indulge in six of them for the price of one unique night at Alinea,N

Alinea I only agreed to go because Alinea was in Chicago and I wanted some good eats We arrived at the front steps on Alinea and was greeted by a doorman that opened the door We walked in only seeing walls and no door So what did we do? We continued walking and prayed for a door to appear All of a sudden poof a secret door slid open on the left and we walked through and was greeted by a hostess We waited a few minutes while our table was being set up and took a glimpse of the kitchen The kitchen was immaculate and things were moving like clock work While walking upstairs to our table I saw that the room was very modern and minimal with a touch of techno  I dont know Its hard to explain We were seated greeted and given a snippet of what was to come The menu was not given to us because they wanted it to be more of a surprise Once situated the meal began and we were served 22 courses of gastronomically incredible dishes Some favorites were Yuba shrimp miso togarashi Rabbit parfait rillette consomme Hot potato cold potato black truffle butter Short rib olive red wine blackberry Black truffle explosion romaine parmesan Venison lingonberry gruyere fireplace kindling Spruce peppermint tea Everything was amazing There was one dish that caught me off guard and I must share the experience So a plate was presented to us with a mountain of shaved ice and an oyster shell on top with a leaf on top of the shell I saw oyster and was somewhat hesitant because I dont like oysters BUT I was going to say no to it So I lifted up the leaf to see that there was no oyster I was like dude wheres my oyster? Our server explained to us that the leaf is grown in Scotland and it tastes just like oysters I ate my leafy oyster and guess what? It tasted exactly like and oyster Legendary The meal overall was amazing It was a heavy price to pay but the food and experience was worth every penny The service was phenomenal Everyone was really nice and they all had a witty sense of humor This dining experience was interactive exciting and definitely memorable,N

Big Duck? Awkward Duck? I am pretty sure it had Duck in there somewhere In the end I can honestly say this place is a 5 star restaurant but I am not giving it five stars even though it deserves it My main reason for not doing this is fearing that I send someone here who comes away disappointed Bubbles has a sophisticated palate and would absolutely love it My friend who lives up the street in a house with no furniture and empty pizza boxes on the kitchen counter not so much,N

I think it is absolutely worth it Although one could not dine there very often I recommend you at least try it once to see the possibilities of what can be done with food I would say wherever you come from Alinea is worth the trip alone People say it is a once in a lifetime experience but I am excited to say that I will be back many times in my lifetime Enjoy,N

When I went to Alinea I had been traveling all over the country due to my job and was eating out almost every day I enjoy good food but at some point I was starting to experience restaurant fatigue at every fancy or great place I was going to Great the steak tasted amazing the fish was awesome so on and so forth but I felt like Id seen the same twists at other restaurants Alinea was able to take my taste buds on a REAL adventure It was like if you were straight edge and then all of a sudden you took acid My world exploded The food As others have mentioned this is molecular gastronomy which means most of the time you have no idea what you are eating Its abstract art in edible form But whatever comes out is whimsical and different from what youve experienced before We went for the 24 course meal Should have heeded the warning to NOT get the wine flight They dont skimp on refilling your glass We were so full and uncoordinated I felt like someone needed to carry me out of the restaurant The service impeccable Our sommelier and waiter were charming and extraordinarily patient with us considering we were the last ones to leave the restaurant and also were generally making asses out of ourselves See above statement about NOT GETTING THE WINE FLIGHT to make sure you do not end up us Playing Lady Gaga loudly over your iPhone for 30 seconds and asking what wine goes best with Filet-O-Fish is probably something that would get you kicked out of an establishment like this yet somehow these folks managed to remain friendly and down-to-earth-best-Midwest-nice-without-being-overbearing Also who would have thought it but this is fine dining at its most accommodating 1 One of our party is vegan and the kitchen made all 24 of his courses vegan friendly I was extremely impressed with the results For example when the rest of our group got the infamous bacon on a swing dish our veg friend got a dish that looked exactly like it It was an apple slice carved to look like a piece of bacon Yes I am easily amused 2 If Grant Achatz is there he will sign your menu Squeal now foodies And even if he isnt apparently you can ask for him to sign it anyways and then Alinea will mail it to you Dont say I didnt warn you anything you eat for weeks after going to Alinea is just going to taste like unflavored oatmeal,N

Would I really like it? Or would I just convince myself that I was enjoying it because of the price tag I am happy to report that Alinea did not disappoint  We had 22 courses 15 presentations and with every one we were blown away Highlights  Getting to play with my food and being encouraged to do so  My favorite dishes Hot potato cold potato hamachi short rib and of course the chocolate mousse  The staff was so knowledgeable and yet down to earth  Personalized Menu my husband had an abbreviated wine tasting and the menu even reflected this We were so lucky to get Chef Grant to make our dessert I dont know if any restaurant can top that,N

There Youre about at the price for two for Alinea and since Alinea dining averages four hours youve spent the same amount of time either night Compare the price to that not to that of your current favorite restaurant And Im willing to bet that Alinea would be the one of the two options above that you remember for the rest of your life Its definitely more out of this world My wife and I do not have money fights Shes a teacher Im a community college mid-level administrator We made it work to come here twice by not dining out for a few weeks in a row and giving up booze each time which is not exactly a sacrifice in order to afford something for which there exists simply no other comparable or approximate experience Alinea is not another restaurant - its its own type of satisfaction  A digressing note to any Alinea employee potentially reading this Off the bat you all do perfect work thank you for doing so much to really enhance the first and second best dining experiences Ive ever had I admire your memory capabilities agility juggling dishes and superlative commitment to service It is in the most constructive vein that I suggest you stop the practice of pretending to remember - to the very date even -- the last time a customer dined at your restaurant Its at best cute when you open a food explanation with a pseudo-spontaneous I believe when you were here last April the 12th was it when you had the Especially when you did not serve us last time Maybe some CRM research shows other diners think you really remembered them and appreciate the fleeting specialness but I doubt it And nothing else you do is transparent,N

Yes Would I go again soon? Probably not Since so much of the experience is trying the strange concoctions I feel like it would be a waste to try the same menu again Ill wait a few years and then return,N

At the end of the night the douchebaggery and eye-raping was worth it because my parents love fine dining and could not stop raving about each course They fell in love with this place As long as theyre happy Im happy Cant have it all,N

DISAPPOINTING I couldnt even finish the rabbit consumme even though it was probably 7spoonful And why was there something that resembled a baby walrus tooth hidden in the fried part of my course 9?

Indeed Over the top? Of course There isnt much to add to the praise already laid out on this Yelp page One thing I dont see mentioned a lot is the environment there While this is a luxurious over-the-top experience I wouldnt go here for a romantic night out The focus is all on the food and the wine So long gushy conversations get cut-off descriptions and instructions for the next dish or glass of wine Oh and as someone who has a pretty minimal knowledge of wine I sort of wish the sommelier could dumb down his descriptions a bit I actually mentioned to him that I didnt know a ton about wine but that didntt stop the descriptions and wine comments that were way over my head Highlights - Black Truffle Explosion monocrhomatic white bass rabbit rillete earl grey tea dessert Now that I have gone once I am worried I am going to be looking for excuses to head back soonish,N
11,2,2010,02NCU6z,ARXswZQ4aDfhPnMYSbzcSw,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,4,4,15,2,Disappointment in the food You will not get the best meal in your recent memory here not even close With a couple of exceptions it was NOT innovative It wasnt even about fresh ingredients no not really Sometimes it did more to confuse the tastebuds than anything pleasant It borrowed shamelessly from other cultures and the outcome paled in comparison or was completely wrong Seriously the ignorance But could the average diner even tell? I could rip into some of the bites in more detail but its not worth it The homage to Escoffier was the worst for me - the squab was lukewarm which is oh so ironic The stone soup while a cheeky idea was medicinal Not to mention 3 out of the 4 waiters were just reciting the same descriptions all night The only thing they had down was the pace of the service Again its another reminder that our culture buys into experiences that ultimately leave us feeling unsatisfied This was just a big masquerade no substance Cmon Grant - whos watching over your kitchen? Keller said if you can taste the seasoning then youve overdone it Well every other dish was salty There were also inedible artifacts in two separate courses that we had Ugh the lack of attention to detail is insulting,N

Also my reservation was at 530 so the restaurant is just beginning their service which makes the servers almost too attentive At my table I faced the openness of the room which allowed me to take note of everything that was happeningenjoyable bc I was able to see the process but also a little annoying bc I could see them hawking my table trying to gauge when to come over  So my advice is to sit facing a wall if that will make you uncomfortable Overall it was a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to go back,N

Please read on I am giving Alinea five stars because this was a dining experience like none other delivered by a staff that if they put their mind to it could save the world from every single challenge this globe is facing The restaurant is impossible to find from the outside as its entrance is intentionally hidden at the end of a rabbit hole like cave in a typical building like every other on the street Be on time this is like showing up to a theater you have to be at your table at the time of the reservation Dress appropriately Men should wear a shirt and a jacket women should dress up like theyre going out Jeans are probably not a good idea This is a formal affair dress like a formal affair On the other hand as a proponent of casual clothes and being comfortable while you eat I would like to recommend that you not overdo it with ties and uncomfortable getups Be comfortable but sharp looking and you will do fine Once inside youre seated at your own table briefed about the meal ahead asked about your preferences in terms of refreshments offered the wine matching option The restaurant is softly lit and relatively quiet Watch out if you have a big voice like I do -- you will have to remind yourself to talk softly Before making a reservation at this restaurant please check their website first to see if the ingredients in the individual courses agree with your dietary restrictions I have seafood allergies specifically shellfish If you inform Alinea ahead of time they will make accommodations for you in the course line up There are two options 12 course meal and 24 course meal We made the mistake of being over-enthusiastic and picking the 24 course meal with wine pairings Every piece that was presented to us was unique delicious and a work of art in itself I am sure every other reviewer has attempted to describe the line up and such I wont go into all that detail here I HIGHLY recommend first timers to get the 12 course meal You think you can do the 24 but youre wrong and you have no idea what youre getting yourself into Its not the quantity of the food thats the problem its the number of ingredients By the time we hit 18 neither my mother nor I wanted to see food ever again for the rest of our lives because the number of ingredients in our tummies was probably about in the hundreds Take that and mix it with the 12 wines we had tasted by that point and you have yourself one hell of an upset tummy I literally turned green after 16 which I think was the lobster -- which I have not reacted to before although it is shellfish So I had a small tiny piece of it I got very ill in a very short period of time but I assumed it was a temporary thing and that it would pass I was not about to lose my dinner or anything But the feeling of something horrible is about to happen never passed When we hit course 18 I called the wait staff and told them to stop bringing us more food and bring us the bill They were super nice and courteous about our early departure by the way which made me feel even worse than I was feeling for leaving We got the check Alinea was super nice to us with the check they discounted the courses we did not have and the wine we did not drink This was a class act I was ready to pay the full amount and leave as soon as possible Needless to say I barely made it to my room at our hotel to find my insides boiling up and refusing to stay in me I hate to say it but I lost all 300 dollars worth of exotic spices meats foliage vegetables and beautiful design down the toilet in less than 15 minutes I was sick for the rest of the night and it kind of ruined my birthday After this incident things did not taste right for two weeks Everything tasted salty to me To this day the smell of peanut paste  a flavoring that was omni present in almost every we ate at Alinea makes me throw up a little in my mouth Ok I kid about that part - Am I complaining about Alinea? No not one bit These were a bunch of beautiful talented hard working individuals that put on a feast and show for all senses I think this restaurant helped me realize my dislike for multi course meals and fusion cuisine So the problem is with me not with Alinea Let me story be a cautionary tale If you have not done this before proceed with caution get the tasting menu -- 12 courses and not the grand tour -- 24 courses Do not get the wine pairings unless youre an experienced wine connoisseur -- as it adds up in terms of volume fast and you end up mixing champagne white wine and several red wines -- a recipe for disaster for someone like me -- a light light drinker,N

Really?

Alineas answer is one The staff read our minds or eavesdropped on our conversation and asked us if we wanted to see the kitchen at the stroke of midnight when our meal ended The kitchen was starting to wind down which gave Chef Chad a chance to explain to us the wax molds he was working on No sign of Grant Achatz but Chad was good enough eye candy for me In closing Alinea is not about what you do or dont like It is about the appreciation of an unnamed sensation a flavor that leaves you at a loss for words and a culinary innovation that is only beginning to take flight in the United States It is the technology of the early adopter and the beta version of a cuisine that is not yet commercially viable Some art forms are more accessible to the intellect--others just need to be studied to be appreciated Alinea 100 - Introduction to Molecular Gastronomy check,N

This was the best overall food experience Ive ever had after all The wait staff Normally I dont discount stars for the staff because its the food that counts but when youre paying THIS much money its important that nothing detract from the dining experience You should feel comfortable and welcome and taken well care of  We were in an upper dining room with only three other tables active and about 4 or 5 young men -- early 20s -- working the room and they seemed to think that whenever they werent actively doing something for a diner no eyes were on them Giggling and evidently talking shit about paying-through-the-nose customers in the adjacent dining room playing little private jokes on each other at the table that they thought were over the customers heads and just generally making the environment almost uncomfortable It wasnt just sophomoric it was fraterniacal word or no word It really seemed like they needed a floor manager or something to keep them in line These misbehaving children needed some supervision The sommelier was one of these young guys and while he was nice enough we had the following interchange  Him Blah blah blah wine pairings arent scary dont be overwhelmed blah blah blah we can customize the pairings depending on your tastes we wont show you the food menu before you eat blah blah blah you just let me know and we can make something work together Me Great yes Im definitely getting the wine pairing Since we wont know the menu in advance Id just like to request that you make it as red-heavy as possible Him Well see theres a lot of fish I dont really know I dont really know if we can do anything A pairing is really supposed to complement the food you know Me Yeah well Maybe a pinot noir with one of the fish dishes? Seriously just make your best effort and Im sure Ill be happy Him Well it will be really tough Wait I know just the one As the meal went it turned out he was totally lying He just poured me a bigger glass of the pinot noir that was earmarked for a lamb dish with the fish dish that preceded it Weak Was it a good match? Yes But purely by accident and really what I wanted was variety not just more of the same red wine At the end of the day maybe he should have just told me that he couldnt make substitutions if he couldnt Wed all have been happier Overall the pairings were solid with a couple that were really stellar a madeira and a thick red douro not a port But did he even set the pairs? There were at least two sommeliers active in the restaurant while we were there and I strongly doubt there were two sets of pairings When we left I was happy and full and thrilled by the food For most other fine restaurants wed have paid around half as much and had food that was proportionally less-inspiring BUT service that was just as proficient AND ten times more professional Fix this problem and this becomes a guaranteed five-star experience,N
6,21,2006,RtUc8ds,qfIxyeZVnmZy9mQL80UuPA,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,1,9,5,The most expensive meal in my lifeand somehow one of the best values in my life How can that be? The drama of merely entering the restaurant is enough to take your breath away and then the service calm and sophisticated ambience little gee-whiz gadgets and tricks and the food oh the food We were not able to get reservations for the tour 25 courses or so But our 12 course tasting was more than plenty at 125 a pop for the food and I think that once he rotates through some new dishes I will go back for the easier on the wallet 8 course We did the wine pairing which they say is around 23 the cost of the food My math says that 90 compared with 125 is more like 34ths but whos counting at a place like this The wines were just as memorable as the food and I strongly recommend that you a go for the wine pairings or at least some of them and b make sure youre taking a cab afterwards How so much flavor can be packed into single bites and then how I can get so richly full from these single bites will always be a mystery I could go through the highlights but that would require walking through all 12 dishes Only one that Ill mention as such a surprise was the Kobe beef with teriyaki reduction cucumber andmelon? Who in the world says to themselves Hmmwhat goes well with Kobe beef? Oh I know honeydew melon of course Genius Like many foodies-in-training I seek value Alenia is a place that proves that ridiculously guilt-inducing prices can sometimes still be a value when it buys 3 or 4 hours of food perfection,N

2,3,2011,xzdWtzP6,eZKwkvV1JBWSjUC4hlfAog,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,2,3,5,This review was from a meal I had at Alinea in July of 2010 Unbelievable Truly I wish there was a special 5+ Stars rating on Yelp while my other reviews are based on relative quality from one another Alinea is not just 1 star better than my other 4 star restaurants in fact they are much better than most of the 5 star restaurants I list all of which deserve their ratings The bottom line is that there is a difference between restaurants that are absolutely amazing and restaurants like Alinea that exceed culinary boundaries you thought were static  impenetrable I was constantly exclaiming to my girlfriend I had no idea flavors and textures like this were even possible Im still not sure how to describe this nearly 5 hour meal other than it contained more elements of discovery and participation than I had anticipated In fact I am revealing some of the details here only because the menu has changed since this visit For example  We were instructed on how to create a frame from some pieces in a box Once this was completed they took the centerpieces two flags from our table and draped them over our frames It turned out that each flag was comprised of rice paper with herbs pressed in-between From there we were instructed on how to create a spring-roll-esque dish out of it We added pork belly curry cucumber and lime among other ingredients  The pillow of fresh cut grass aroma which our plate was set upon slowly releasing a complimentary scent to the dish  The dessert chocolate w coconut menthol and hyssop which Chef Achatz made directly on our table into a piece of modern edible art The entire meal is served or rather guided by ~6 different people They explained each dish in some detail and instructed exactly how it should be eaten such as this is a hands free dish you should pull this off the wire in one bite Other Highlights  Ice cream-like english peas w iberico sherry and honeydew each spoonful produced a completely different flavor  Lobster tempura on a vanilla bean w lychee gruyere and vanilla fragrance we were instructed to scrape the vanilla bean with our teeth as we ate the tempura  Black truffle explosion w romaine and parmesan like its name suggests this ravioli explodes in your mouth with liquids containing unbelievably rich flavors  Distillation of Thai flavors a shot of liquid that perhaps due to the power of suggestion tasted like a complete Thai dish something out of Woody Allens Sleeper The flavors like the presentation were outstanding and unlike anything I had ever experienced before The bottom line if you love food you really need to make a reservation here plan on making your reservation well in advance On that note when I made my reservations they were taking names for 2 - 3 months out on the first day of the current month so if you want to make a reservation for sometime in October your best bet is to call right on August 1st If however you wait too long and all reservations are full youll still have the option to be put on a waiting list Also if you have any food allergies or preferences Gluten Free no Sour Cream etc let them know theyll make alternatives for you Next time I do this Ill be requesting no sardines That was the only dish I really had trouble with Alinea iswas depending on when you are reading this review the highest ranked restaurant in North America by the famous San Pellegrino Worlds 50 Best Restaurants awards 1 in North America 7 in the World 2010 as well as the recipient of the Outstanding Service award from the James Beard Foundation and the 1 spot in Chicago Magazines Chicagos Top 40 Restaurants Ever 2010 While this praise raised my expectations to ridiculous heights Alinea completely exceeded each and every one of them in terms of style service and taste This was without question the most unique and wonderful culinary adventure I have ever partaken,N

Thats a whole assembly line on the manufacturing floor of some company I would think the 35 hour dining experience was simply unbeatable it flew on by quickly without us realizing itwe were hoping it would never end The food portion was decent sized and we were not stuffed over the top and neither did we leave hungry it was a very satisfying a nice comfortable feeling The 12 course flight tasting menu was delightful as Yelper Jeremy L pointed out wagyu beef covered within a bowl of pine leaves and the pumpkin pie served skewed on a burnt oak branch dish served on a fluffy pillow filled with nutmeg aroma scallop served in a bowl on top of a dish filled with hot water and chamomile and lavender and the server was joking that we could have steamed our face for facialit was such a nice pleasure to witness all these creativity in presentation and food decor Unbelievable With 81 reviews and 5 star rating you simply cant go wrong Great for that special occassion or simply a just because meal GO and make that reservation right now Its soooooooo worth it Every single morsel of it Im not sure when well be back to Chi-town but I would dine in Alinea again in a heart beat Remarkable,N
2,26,2011,FP9wq,MGCwT5aUf_KKZ30L-Y6Y1w,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,1,1,5,We went to alinea for our first anniversary Being foodies like most yelpers and living in chicago for about 7-8 years we had to try it I would agree with Patrick N to not read the reviews too much and just try it for yourself The surprises and theatrics of the meal are what make it This was one of the most memorable experiences I have had in a meal and its worth the price for once every couple of years when they change the menu We have a full set of pictures from when we went and i may upload the video of Grant Achatz making our desert He didnt do this for everyone so we felt particularly lucky that he did it for our table The food is of course amazing and even if you have dietary restrictions which we did they will be accommodate every request There are some reviews of people who did not have an excellent time so this may happen to some and if it does to you that sucks because you will be footing a pricey bill However for the most part people leave happy and thats hard to do when people are paying 250+ a person,N
8,11,2009,O,fj_GmJkMe1YV9nojmScKvA,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,6,12,4,4,A THOUGHT I feel like people HAVE to write good reviews of this place Its required I mean you spend so much money dang it youd BETTER LOVE IT And even if you didnt love it for real youll MAKE yourself love it bc you dont want to look stupid for blowing your rent money on dinner That being said this place is pretty amazing I dont know if its bc Im SUPPPOSED to love it but it was a great experience one that Ill remember for years to come FOOD The food was not only interesting and complex but aromatically and visually engaging as well It really is an event It takes hours And I found joy in the way I was challenged by the food It was actually pretty inspirational in some ways I liked that even after 15 or 20 courses cant remember how many there were its been a few months I didnt feel over-stuffed STAFFSERVICE The staff wasnt mad that we didnt drink wine In fact they had a great alternative they suggested something they had picked out for the Alcoholics? some sparkling juice that didnt interfere with the food WHY ONLY 4 STARS? My rating is more of an in between 4 and 5 The reason it flirts with 4 is because of inaccessibility for the financially challenged I mean I like good food and will pay the price but this is flirting with ridiculous Its kind of like how I wouldnt pay 2000 for shoes Even though I can appreciate its design and aesthetics and fawn over it and say things like Yes it IS genius it is the perfect shoe I still cant bring myself to buy it So even though I might pay 500 for a pair of shoes which I think is still a lot in the end it doesnt make me feel great This is couture food And I appreciate couture And I can champion their existence with the rest of them But the inaccessibility though it may be celebrated by many is not a celebrated quality for me personally And I dont mean to say conversely that cheap production for the masses is a quality I necessarily prize either though I can appreciate its contributions as well But like I say in my profile no one should really read my reviews anyway So dont get mad,N

I asked as he handed me back the car keys That was awfully nice of you And then I tried to give him a tip and he refused politely Never before had I experienced someone being so kind to find me a parking spot and refuse a tip Perhaps its the astounding attention to service at Alinea or Midwestern kindess but I would love it if more people were like Alineas valet staff ,N

Who would have thought it My friends who did the wine pairings were impressed and enjoyed the wine more than the food I think Presentation was exquisite A great dining adventure that I only need to experience once Im giving it three stars because Alinea needs to be taken down a notch I feel that the overabundance of 5 star reviews is deceiving and skews perception,N

We both answered coffee and thought nothing of it When the bill came there was a 15 addition for coffee Now Im not a stingy penny-pincher and on a 600 bill 15 is a drop in the bucket but it has left me with a feeling that Alinea is a little sneaky Maybe its nit-picky but it just sort of bummed me out Luckily the meal was so good that my memories are still fond Still a definite must go,N

11,2,2010,CUedCS,xgVQ7ZIFPCE7Z25mlBgrQw,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,0,5,5,After dining at Alinea I was torn about how I felt overall After a couple days I realized that in my opinion at least Alinea may have to be reviewed in a different context than other restaurants Im not going to claim that I know good food or that I have an amazing sense for anything culinary but I do feel that I have a strong appreciation for the heart and soul people pour into creating and maintaining their vision of a restaurant Ive heard some people compare Grant Achatz to Willy Wonka and I would have to agree with that assessment I enjoyed myself and my meal immensely I would have to say that the service and presentation of the food stood out the most While outstanding service is self-explanatory the presentation of each course was meticulously crafted Everything down to the custom-made plates and sculpture-like items used to present the food was inspired The taste of the food however was varied and not always in a good way I realize that I am not going to be wowed by every single course but my palette left me wanting more of the one bite style courses and less of the heavy rich ones I understand that its just how the cards fell but it was a bit of a bummer for me because darn it that Hot Potato  Cold Potato dish was so good I supposed I will have to consult the Alinea book my wife purchased to see how I can make that and the awesome Bubble Yum stock Thats not to say I didnt appreciate each course The flow of the meal was perfectly paced The starting courses revolved around lighter cleaner flavors and slowly progressed into rich and heavy offerings before transitioning into the dessert portions Over the course of the 3 12 hour meal the staff starts to feel like old friends especially if youve had some wine Which brings me to another point - they specialize in wine pairings and offer a small selection of beer only So you wont be able to booze it up while you eat  Overall I feel that this was indeed a special once-in-a-lifetime type of meal It did not change my life nor did it make me feel like I ascended to some higher state of consciousness Instead it was a pleasant and unique diversion from anything you might come to expect from your typical critically-acclaimed restaurant I count myself as extremely lucky to have experienced it,N

My particular server was really good and I liked the fact that the entire staff worked together to ensure your meal was always moving After the meal we took a peak into the kitchen with our waiter and about a week later we received an autographed copy of our menu which really meant a lot to us Would I go here again? Probably - maybe for 15th Anniversary Would I take friends? Not likely I would rather have a nice dinner at a reasonably priced restaurant with friends where I can treat the whole crew for the price of one meal at Alinea Great food Great ambiance Great service Great presentation REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE And I dont feel like less of a person for saying that,N

Are you crazy? Well working until 9pm on a Wednesday night leaves little room to arrive at a 930 reservation But thanks to my managers who let me leave early and the fact that I changed met my boyfriend and practically broke the speed of sound driving there we arrived right on time phew Now to the main event I was so nervous walking in it was almost as if I was going to meet the President rather than sitting down to dinner You walk down a long corridor and sliding doors open where lovely servers greet you warmly To your right you catch a glimpse of the kitchen where the best food is being prepared just for you How exciting My boyfriend his friend and I were seated upstairs We were fully prepared to do the 23 course tour as it is called but we did not get the wine pairings with it Instead we were encouraged to try a nearly 30 year old wine that would go with almost everything we tried that night We were given nothing but the best service knowledge about what we were trying and care Alinea loves you And you cant help but love it back I cant count the number of times my boyfriend and I looked in awe over our friends head at what wonderful treats we would be given next We were scolded like children for not answering a question or paying attention to a story But it can hardly be helped When you are given pheasant tempura skewered on a burning branch of oak leaves or a tube of long pepper hibiscus and creme fraiche to mimic the taste of bubble gum what else can you do but gasp in delight like a 5 year old meeting Mickey Mouse for the first time at Disney World?? You clap your hands in delight and close your eyes encasing every taste smell and sound your senses explode upon you Its like a dream you never want to end But end it does and what an ending The table cloth removed and a special silicone mat placed over the table Two chefs come out one of them being none other than Grant Achatz himself and pour an overwhelming amount of freeze dried blueberries chocolate mousse and even a tobacco sauce all over the table We were given nothing but a spoon and then we had to duke it out on who ate what and got the last bites The servers were funny caring and catered to all our needs We asked questions we engaged them in conversation and there was nothing but smiles all aroundThey werent pretentious or snobby Although we ate for nearly 3 hours I was comfortably full and couldnt ask for anything more I have nothing but praise and good words for Alinea Anyone who says less was probably having a bad day before they stepped inside At the end of the best meal of your life you are given a small menu listing what you ate during your tour Asking nicely we wondered if Mr Achatz would sign our menus to which the waiter agreed Refine and Redefine is written on mine It holds very true to Alineas mantra Did I say that Alinea loves you? Because I love it right back,N

Nope Butter and 3 types of Salt? Nada Chocolates to take home? No way I applaud Achatz He highly deserves his ratings To leave culinary mecca and create a completely original and imaginative restaurant and food concept is rare these days and something that is hard to find From start to finish everything is not just delicious but also beautifully presented as if it were a work of art and at times requires a diners personal interaction with the foodsits all quite amazing and truly an unforgettable experience So12 courses at Alinea for 150 or 9 courses at French Laundry for 240?

I have in the form of Alinea I never knew these whimsical places actually existed until I brought my palate here Course after course I fell deeper down the rabbit hole Words like creative and unique dont even come close to describing the fare served at Alinea Grant Achatz really is our modern day Willy Wonka As our 4 year anniversary approached we really felt there was no where more suiting than Alinea to spend it in Chicago has become a favorite city of ours and I a huge fan or Mr Achatz We made our reservation for the 29 course tour menu and started counting down the days As we made our way down the pink glowing hallway my heart was racing with excitement Even though we were 30 minutes early for our reservation we were greeted by name and sat anyway We made our way up the stairs my eyes darting looking for even a small clue as to what our evening would bring us The minimalistic decor provides a blank backdrop so the food really is the star A caterpillar like cascade of purple flowers sat behind our dinner table and set the tone for the whimsy to come The overall feel of the atmosphere is genuinely fun There was a level of service and class without it feeling stuffy or pretentious No dish was ever explained in a condescending manner no waiter was rude and the room filled with laughter as the courses continued to arrive  Some dishes shined more than others some were true to the molecular gastronomy fad while others simply showcased simple and amazing flavors The dishes to me that were the greatest stars of the night were as follows Course 5- A do-it-your-self pork belly spring roll At the beginning of the meal we were presented with 2 sheets of rice paper beautifully draped over a small wooden stand In the papers were flowers and herbs When the course arrived we assisted in constructing a sort of tee-pee for the rice paper to sit in Sweet and succulent coconut curried pork belly was spooned into the center and you chose your own additions off of a plate of 11 ingredients I choose black sea salt lime onion and additional herbs I wrapped it all up and was wrapped up in the flavors of that dish the whole night It was by far my favorite It was like Thai street food made glamorous Course 10- Thai banana with a square of frozen Guinness beer with mustard and pecans I truly wished this course was more than one bite it was the definition of balance Course 12- Powdered peanut butter when mixed with your saliva returned to an original creamy peanut butter texture followed by Cayenne pepper In terms of creativity I felt this dish stood out amongst the rest The way the flavors developed from peanut to pepper was indescribable Course 13- Foie Gras which seemed to be frozen pushed through a sieve over pear and white wine sorbet My boyfriend and I both couldnt stop talking about this dish It was like heavenly Foie ice cream I wanted another scoop Course 18- Part of what was called cocktail hour at Alinea A passion fruit Hurricane with all the traditional New Orleans flavors This drink was like first sip of ice cold Kool-aid on a hot summer day when you are 8 years old It was perfection Course 23- One pound cake bite with strawberry and lemon sitting on a bed of almond sugar We were literally instructed to enjoy this dish like fun-dip Eat the pound cake then lick the vanilla bean and scoop up the almond sugar Besides the fact that it was pound cake perfection any chef who uses fun-dip as inspiration gets an A in my book Course 27- Earl gray cookies lemon custard candied pine nuts and caramelized white chocolate served on a pillow of Earl Grey scented air Can I say anymore? This dish was really like cookies and childhood It was playful rich sweet and had a wonderful presentation 5 hours later I was on a culinary high My belly was near the point of exploding but it was all well worth it I love that the whole meal brought you home and brought you back to childhood The raspberry transparency was like a grown-up fruit roll up I even caught myself making little faces as I ate it I loved course 24 which involved us sucking gelee grown-up Jell-O creme fraiche grown-up pudding and Bubble Yum out of a tube What is more fun than that? Even the playful nature of the dessert that is prepared on your table was simply a chef playing with food Nothing about the meal was too serious too full of itself or too out of reach for any palate to enjoy  My night at Alinea will be one I will never forget Meals that leave an impact on me are some of my fondest memories of life I look forward to all the things Chef Grant is going to do and all of the minds he is going to open up to fun cooking I for one will always trust my Willy Wonka and take one more bite down the yellow-brick road,N

But once the space starts filling up and youre onto your 2 or 3rd pairing of wine which I highly recommend you get Its unbelievable this incredibly special experience becomes truly exceptional Every dish was amazing But the ones I loved the most were a pork belly DIY asian spring roll type thing I am glad Ive had some model airplane building experience in my youth because this one required some assembling and disassembling of the place setting Probably also helped that it was one of the earlier dishes before the buzz of the wine set in Also fantastic was the most amazing piece of beef Ive ever had incredibly marbled was it wagyu perhaps?

Two of the dishes had coriander in them and it really overpowered what was underneath it One fish dish in particular I did not care for the fish at alli found it WAYYYY too fishy BUT in Alineas defense I know that the fish was not bad it was simply a fishy type of fishmy Asian friends who we dined with loved the fish so I knew it was A OK just not my thing I wish I could remember what kind of fish it was The desserts are so different and a lot of fun to eat This is definitely the type of place you must be prepared to be spending anywhere from 200 - 400 a head maybe more All in all a great dining experience indeed,N
9,9,2010,xb2-6P,avxD6r3_MquP6xBbiaUHNw,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,1,3,2,5,Alinea has recently been hailed as the Best Restaurant in the US and 7 in the World With such status I had extremely high expectations and quite honestly was a bit worried that Id expect too much and be let down Instead I was COMPLETELY blown away by my experience at Alinea and would have to whole heartedly agree that its the best restaurant Ive been to in the US sorry French Laundry Whats even more remarkable is that Alinea has only been around for 5 years during part of which Chef Grant Achatz had battled tongue cancer Words can not adequately describe the phenomenal meal I had at Alinea It is a true experience in all forms - the surprise of hidden sliding doors interacting with the unique presentations of each dish anticipating what the next extraordinary course would bring and most importantly having my taste buds delighted and pushed to the limit with innovative incredible food You really do just have to experience it for yourself The food at Alinea is progressive ambitious artistic and totally original It was creative without being gimmicky Chef Achatz and his team take modern American cuisine to a whole new level with their inventive genius The service was impeccable Every need was anticipated before we had to ask for anything The staff was professional courteous and very knowledgeable I learned so much about the food and wine [BTW I highly recommend the reserve wine pairing The wine beautifully complemented the food - an impressive feat with ~20 courses] The only thing I didnt love about my experience at Alinea was the ambience The dining room there are 3 is a small rectangular room with modern minimalist dcor in cool grey beige and black tones It felt impersonal and lacked warmth Its a good thing that the food was so mesmerizing else itd be awkward to be in such a sparse room where you are so acutely aware of your neighbors But maybe that was intentional and they want you to just focus on the food A few of my favorite courses ENGLISH PEA - unlike anything Ive ever eaten before Peas were mixed with frozen burrata cheese and dusted with Iberico ham powder It was ice cold yet creamy salty sweet and meaty all at once The sherry bubbles and melon would also transform each bite by accentuating different flavors TOMATOES - this dish transported me to another place I was initially confused and intrigued when they put pillows on top of the table Then I started to smell the fresh grassy aroma emitted by the pillows Once the plate of heirloom tomatoes was set on the pillows more of the aroma was emitted as the pillows deflatedit was like eating ripe tomatoes straight from the garden If summer had a taste this would be it PORK BELLY- this pork belly was ABSOLUTELY ORGASMIC It had been slowly simmered in coconut milk and just melted in my mouth I wanted more HOT POTATO - great things really do come in small packages A metal pick slides down to drop a piece of butter hot potato and black truffle into the tiny wax bowl filled with cold potato soup Let me say that againTruffles Potatoes Butter Totally my kind of comfort food This was so delicious it took all my restraint to keep myself from licking the bowl clean EARL GREY - I was ready to dislike this dessert because I detest early grey tea but this was surprisingly my favorite dessert of the evening It was a moist and crumbly early grey cake served with pine nut custard lemon curd and rose gele The flavors were so well balanced - buttery sweet tart and with just a hint of bitterness from the earl grey The caramelized white chocolate noodle also added a playful yet tasty touch CHOCOLATE - The ultimate demonstration of fantasy and wonder at Alinea You will have to see this for yourselfa tableside presentation like no other After our 4 hour meal I felt inspired and completely enchanted Alinea made me fall in love with food all over again Ive had many great meals but few have left me feeling so awestruck The 185 tasting menu is pricey but still a bargain considering the number of elaborate and well-executed coursesa small price to pay for one of the best meals of my life For a full review and pics of each course go to my blog link under my profile,N

I wont bury the lede  yes It aint cheap but if you want a meal that you will flat-out be talking about years from now this is the place Was every single bite and meal the greatest thing I ever had? No But I remember each and every single bite like it was yesterday So does my wife I look at our menu with fond recollections Seriously save 15week for a year skip pizza night every other week really and the have a night that you will remember And isnt that the best thing about food the memories?

To celebrate a special anniversary and as my final meal before my Chicago Marathon my partner in culinary crime and I headed to Grant Achatzs celebrated molecular gastronimic restaurant Alinea Securing reservations for this place was the most difficult aside from Momofuku ko in NYC which I have given up on that I have experienced Even concierge services have trouble landing a table here Luckily thanks to the handy redial button reservations were made and the simple question was posed We opted to Take the Tour which consisted of 24 courses Yes t-w-e-n-t-y f-o-u-r Its pretty intimidating to think about especially if you are worried that you cant finish them and especially if you were silly enough to eat a pizza pot pie two hours beforehand But no worries the mission was accomplished The wine pairings and service at Alinea were quite frankly supurb The best Ive experienced in the US As for the food? It was my best meal ever Too much to describe too long of a conversation this would devolve into  The tour included dessert and an assortment of foods prepared in more scientific-inspired styles I could have imaged freeze dried cheese? gelatinized flavor packed tomato cubs? basil ice cream? Guiness beer gelatin layer? My favorite dish was the Wagyu beef from Japan pairing with maitake mushrooms and some secret Elixir Oh yes the answer to my gfs original question Four hours,N

You havent I havent and 999 of the world hasnt Its because it doesnt make any sense to us and we have never been forced to consider ituntil a place like this comes along and shows you what the experience can be like You will TASTE things here that you have never tasted before and you will taste things here in ways that you have never tasted them before They are not traditionally slow cooking and developing flavors here The chef has very specific tastes that he is trying to impart on the diners Most of these tastes and some of these flavors I have never experienced Every dish had multiple components Some worked Some didnt Some had very specific instructions on how to eat them others were specific that there werent any instructions on how to eat them which actually made those instructions specific After most courses we shook are head in agreement that there was a lot going on there or that was good but few courses left us wanting more of any particular dish even though some were only one bite As far as a Dining Experience goes Alinea is tops If this where food is heading it will be an interesting ride but part of the a conversation that we had was that this is the ULTIMATE gluttonous and selfish experience You are not coming here because you are hungry you are coming here because you want to be surprised pleased  entertained It gives new meaning to Dinner Theater  It is worth noting that while the service was impeccable and I do mean IMPECCABLE there is a distinct lack of warmness and personal experience that you get at other similar caliber restaurants Le Bernadin  Daniel We left realizing that no one ever asked us ONE question about ourselves besides Do you have any allergies? When have you ever been anywhere and them not ask you where you were from or if you were celebrating anything etc As much as Alinea exploits our basic weakness for anticipation it neglects our more basic need to feel like we belong are liked or are important None of which is the responsibility of a restaurant but why bother trying so hard with EVERYTHING ELSE just to let this not even be considered Once again you eat here for the experience Having the diner feel like you actually care about them and their experience which you are creating is just as important as anything else When you spend 700 on dinner I dont care who you are you wouldnt mind someone asking your name There is an incredible amount of time and effort that goes into every presentation here and that alone is worth the price of admission However for me Best Restaurant in America is somewhere I would want to eat in again This is not it,N

Im dead serious From the moment you enter the door you are greeted by a narrowing hallway that seems to be a dead-end For a split second you stand there wondering where to go next and then a sliding door magically opens up into the restaurant Sweetnice touch Chef Achatz You are immediately whisked away to where you will spend the rest of the evening on the edge of your seat We unfortunately went with the tasting menu instead of the full but nevertheless it was againthe best dining experience one could ever have With every single item that came to our table it continued to take the dinner to a whole new level Each time it just blew us away We were so pleased with everything I took 40 or so pictures and was bummed to discover that I left my camera in the cab boo hooo I vowed to make reservations at the restaurant every single time Im in Chicago Its worth the money worth the timeand perhaps some will agree Chef Achatz is the second coming after all,N

No Dining experiences are remarkably memorable especially when the company and conversations are exceptional Conversations spiced with delectable and creative flavour combinations are even more memorable The Tour menu our party selected held 26 courses We took the suggested wine pairing and another bottle of Kosta Browne Pinot Noir 2005 despite a subtle disapproval from the sommelier and set out to enjoy every tiny morsel Except that 26 small portions turn out to a rather hefty meal It takes discipline to taste every flavour in turn especially while trying equally hard to savour the flavours of the paired wines and of course their interaction on the palate Its hard to say whether I was successful but it was a marvel of pairing creativity Its intriguing to me how much asian cuisine is pulled into the repertoire of the Chefs imagination -- but clear Vietnamese Japanese and Chinese influences are present along with more N American culinary heritages from Italy France Britain and the like Earl Grey was used in the dessert so back off While I cant say that I was ecstatic during every course I can say I was ecstatic for many of them Not every combination worked perfectly to my tongue - but that doesnt detract from my sense of amazement at the detail and courage it takes to decide to create a tasting menu of such breadth and depth Intimate seating and elegant visually soothing non-distracting decor assures the patron that their attention will be focused on the food Honestly its so very worth paying attention 5 out of 5,N

Well Alinea isnt American French Indian Mexican or any other nationality of food It is just Alinean food Every dish uses texture smell taste and sight to explode your mind with pleasure The dessert was even more special Chef Grant and an assistant personal made the dessert right there at our table I may not be the biggest foodie out there but I became a real food critic after experiencing the best food in Chicago and maybe in the world Go to Alinea and have your best food experience It is completely worth it,N

I was turning the guy away Enough starch I want more room for the actual courses The service is impeccable - light-hearted but informative Couple next to us was tanked makes me wonder why you would do that before experiencing such a fabulous meal? Oh well made for good entertainment,N

Instead what we had was a well executed if slightly overfilling 12-course meal of haute cuisine  There certainly were soaring high points the wagyu beef was not only a fantastic cut but also perfectly prepared the reduction infused with thai flavors was almost Blaine-ish in its magic There were lows the crack pipe-like glass cylinder filled with desserts just didnt do it nor did the gooey cube of potato The staff were expert if not slightly odd at times and the atmosphere was excellent I do feel the wine pairings were not worth the expense I should have trusted myself to go off the list instead All in all I think Alinea was worth the experience but I dont think the experience transcended the sum of its parts I wish I could have had larger portions of a few of the dishes rather than the smaller portions of many dishes but that is the risk of the tasting menu That said nothing anyone could have said on Yelp would have stopped me from going thats how curious I was so if you are like me youll go just temper your expectations,N

But to me it was worth it If you consider that I had 20 courses served over 4 hours and you consider how much effort and premium ingredient went into those courses then the whole experience begins to feel more like dinner theater but in a way that engages all of my senses I havent eaten at many restaurants in this price range so i cant comment on what this price can get you elsewhere But its hard to imagine getting more variety of better quality Maybe you can and I just dont know it OVERALL If I could give it 6 stars I would I have rated far lesser places 5 stars since there is only a single rating to cover the entire experience its really about overall value Despite not being wealthy my wife and I plan to return to Chicago next summer just to eat here Of course we will find other fun things to do too but revisiting Alinea is our real reason for coming back to Chicago,N

And actually the service was great friendly conversational respectful our sommelier didnt treat us like naifs when we asked simple questions about the wine pairing our waiters had mastered the art of being simultaneously knowledgeable about and in awe of the complex techniques their chefs showed off from the kitchen But eating is an experience that involves all of the senses and one year from now when I think about this meal the memory will be of scraping delicious frozen yuzu from an insane minus 200 degree ice cone while the man at the table next to me is asking the waiter for a shout wipe because he has so covered himself in flakes of chocolate followed by the staff asking him to get up while they replace the chair because his mess has stained it to the point of unusability Ill remember biting into a masterpiece of exploding truffle and also how funny it is that the woman at the table next to us sometimes acts JUST like her mother I dont know if there was ambient music playing in the restaurant but I do know that the woman next to us uses Bruno Mars as her cell phone ring tone And Ill remember getting the check and for the first time at a four star restaurant feeling a little like a fool for spending so much money on one dinner Ive left some suspense about one thing did I speak up to the diners? Did I tell the staff? Did they make it right restaurant-speak for free stuff? Heres the thing theres no making it right This is a restaurant full of talented staff who know how much it costs to eat there and who should know how to deal with this situation but didnt The four diners next to us were never chastened - no subtle request to take phone calls outside no gentle reminder to the jacketless man that jackets are required I was reminded twice once when I called for the reservation and once when they called to confirm It should not have been up to us to ask these four people to quiet down And as the only couple sitting next to the group I didnt feel comfortable complaining about them to the staff while they were still sitting there I spoke to our waiter when the group had finally left and he apologized on behalf of the restaurant said all the servers knew they were trouble and they could tell when they walked in that they were pretty drunk already He said they talked in their meetings about how to handle people like that And then he said I wish you had said something sooner I appreciate the sentiment but it sounded like I didnt need to tell him I wish they had acted sooner Three hours into our meal at about the same time that the offenders left a couple was seated nearby to begin theirs My wife and I looked at each other and I knew we were thinking the same thing I wish that was us,N

Each item was a sensory experience whether due to scent using hot bricks to bring out the full scent of fresh rosemary sprigs with a particular dish for example - -amazing and heady for your eyes a sculpture or sorts with the tastes resting at the top for your mouth the consistencies of each food are so varied and unpredictable Each item we ate that night was delicious and ahem might I say arousing? I mean literally my senses were so completely aroused it was so decadent We ate from approx 8pm to maybe 2am fairly nonstop At the end I was full in a good way but also loaded the wine pairings - - perfect and so content The staff were all cordial and our servers had great personality As I recall the four of us spent about 1200 so think of it as a little food vacation that you should experience because you deserve to be a celebutante at least once in your life I keep meaning to go back Ill stop now Im whipping myself into a food frenzy   ,N

3,22,2009,0ZaIorCP,Jrm34VNH85jMCtFevsSz6Q,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,1,1,4,So much has been written about Alinea The restaurant is an extraordinary experience yet I cant give it 5 stars I waited a couple of weeks before writing because I wanted to be sure of my impressions Fyi - we had the twelve-course meal What I didnt like so much fishy-greasy smell when we walked in And overall several preparations were too salty for my taste I was ready to love everything But as the evening progressed I didnt have that blissful yum - bring it on feeling There were too many fried onion slivers as well And one dish had a melted butter ball in a clear wrapper - like one of those bath beads you drop in the tub to dissolve -- except this one came with a warning to puncture it carefully so as to not be sprayed with hot butter Hmm dangerous food interesting What I liked attentive service comfy chairs important because you want to spend hours enjoying the meal The freedom of not looking at a menu - letting the chef decide what to serve Amazing creativity in both food and serving pieces Beautiful presentations the people at the table next to us were snapping photos A wine pairing that complemented the food and let us try interesting varietals and vintages Considering the complexity of the food its too bad that saltiness stands out for me Although there was a new dish based on rhubarb that was gloriously pinky-red and fun I skipped the onions  The dishes were beautiful works of modern art So Im wondering--is it possible to be so complex that something gets lost? Like using all the colors in the palette and ending up with gray? Im glad I went to Alinea Ill always remember the unique presentations and the fun evening with my family If Im looking for purely delicious though Ill choose Tru or Trotters,N

Delicious? Yes? Oh yes I wanted another one The duck with dark chocolate nestled atop the savory duck It was by the far the most ambitious flavor combo of the night and it worked Lobster foam?  Foam that tastes like lobster but looks like foam The ambience does not disappoint either Its very expensive but its a meal that regular folks should have once or twice in their lifetimes I would go again,N
10,2,2009,S8OOJYgq,KURUGmYN2kwDpr6BcEcrRA,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,1,1,5,I highly recommend this place if you have  to spend Alinea is by no means affordable Its uber extravagant for frou-frou food that wont actually fill you up I ate a few pieces of Fannie Mae chocolate and some Garretts caramel popcorn afterwards 5 stars though because after you get over the fact that its  the food and service was phenomenal Youre not paying for the food youre paying for the entire experience The restaurant has no signage outside except for a well dressed guy standing in front He opens the door for you Before you is a short hallway with wavy planks of paneling to the right pink lights illuminating them My friend and I walked to the end only to realize that it was a dead For a brief second I was confused unsure what to do Then miraculously a wall slides open and you see the entrance of the restaurant with 2-3 people greeting you Its like an amusement park ride Service was awesome The well-dressed servers were attentive and some even had a sense of humor The restaurant was a little chilly so I asked the waiter for a glass of hot water Not only did I get a glass and a hot pot of water but they also gave me a pashmina Wowee Food - taste smell touch sight The only thing missing is sound Each plate that came out was incredible talk about avant garde food The interactive senses were seriously at play here Highlights - Dessert served on top of a pillow that expelled scent of lavendar - Dry ice thingy that erupted with billowing white fog scent of grill served with kobe beef and mashed potato cube - An individual bacon drizzled with maple hanging from a thin cable contraption - One spoonful of the most delicious tortellini that exploded with flavorful juice andcaviar? Wanted more Delicious - One slurp of truffle with potato served in a little shell with ingredients strung on a needle From beginning to end we were constantly surprised by presentation and taste Sweet onion cotton candy?? If you are a foodie and have saved up some  for a fantasy food experience you must try this place,N

The place is quite you feel like you are in a library and the servers while very prompt and professional seem very hesitant to chat or even mildly socialize with you and seem to me like they were being watched by some secret cameras to be later judge and fed to the lions if they had steered away from their routine Our meal was fantastic and there could be nothing else said to be that it is what it is- I just preferred motos younger spirit,N

No worries though the waiter explains before you can even ask My palate matured leaps and bounds from this meal alone The service was impeccable It was perfectly orchestrated from beginning to end My glass was never empty There was never a single crumb on my table If you have go to the bathroom 10 times you will use 11 napkins for they replace it every time you leave the table During our dining my boyfriend dropped a little chocolate onto his shirt Not 30 seconds later a small plate with a napkin on it was placed onto our table He picked up the napkin and a shout wipe fell out At the end of the evening upon receiving our copies of the menu to commemorate our experience I noticed that mine was wishing me a Happy Birthdaynice touch So was the extra treat they slid in for me To top it off this is the first time Ive ever been escorted to the door at the end of dining If you love food and drama this place is it,N

Well the plating for one is a true experience at Alinea From the use of a vanilla bean as a utensil to the silicone dessert table Chef Achatz uses many advanced techniques to prepare and serve the food but he does not lose the poetry in the food itself I appreciate how he keeps it simple in order for you to appreciate the food but when you dig into the actual dishes you realize how much thought and preparation goes into each dish I love the carrot handroll with the tobacco extraction and short ribs that you had to make yourself My favorite dish was the cold pea soup but my wifes was the cold potato  hot potato truffle soup and the shrimp stick thing that had an amazing dipping sauce  One thing I will say is that the wait staff was quite attentive but I found some of the more senior wait staff dry and in some ways a bit too stiff Perhaps I am more of a casual person who likes to enjoy his food and the people he is surrounded by so in that sense I would say that I have had better service Its not that anyone was rude but I cant help but wonder if these people take themselves too seriously Its hard to explain but I would have appreciated a little less pretention and a bit more warmth That being said some of the other waiters were also quite funny and nice including a server who had just completed his 2 yr anniversary and had a pleasant personality We waited at the front after dinner as Chef Achatz was kind enough to show us the kitchen and the front of the house specifically the tall female I think her name was Mallory or Melanie was fantastic She gave us a tour of the kitchen and helped make it even more memorable like she understood that for many of us dining here was a once in a lifetime experience  Finally I have read some reviews or blogs about Chef Achatz that dared to proclaim the chef as a prick To that food critic you are an asshole and a pretentious contrarian who suffers from the exact problem that most food critics share someone who abuses his power to share his opinion and someone arrogant enough to think his opinion matters Basically an article about a misunderstanding over a photo taken during the private viewing of Next and Aviary My wife and I couldnt find the Chef more charming and more humble and I must say meeting him and his demeanor made us that much more impressed with the meal This is a guy who beat cancer and during much of the time of his treatment came to work every day This is a genius who is considered by many to be the finest chef in the USA who came to our table and painted our dessert for us This is a guy who thanked me for coming to eat at his establishment and who wanted to make sure our photo came out good  Chef Achatz if you ever come across this review you are a revelation TWO WORDS MAN CRUSH,N

Despite all its greatness i just wasnt a huge fan of the food the experience was amazing but i just dont see myself ever craving something i ate there and i feel like food no matter how complicated it is should leave you dreaming about it tomorrow One of the biggest biggest issues i had with my food was that it was WAY TOO SALTY and i have an extreme salt tooth i put salt on everything i add salt to salt and vinegar chips so i can handle salt and i couldnt handle some most of the dishes that were brought out My friend felt the same way Now unfortunately i dont know if it was just a mistake that day and someone slipped? or if thats just how it is but it made some things difficult to swallow I loved that they gave us menus after the dinner i actually ended up leaving my menu somewhere and when i called they were happy to send me a copy to my home But they never did = sad and lame i absolutely recommend the experience and i hope the salt was just a fluke,N

How was I supposed to know you wanted to hear about my recent campaign to stop the disgusting overuse of truffle in on and around everything in Chicago? I dont use allergies as an excuse So how about asking if I have any dislikes or preferences? Food - to be perfectly honest I was rather disappointed I was happy I had had the Alinea Experience but was rather unimpressed with the food There seemed to be far too much of the same textures aka mushy squares and gelatin squares The only dishes I would say were good were the pork belly the bacon - sweet potato -mustard served as a threesome and the desserts I did also enjoy the cauliflower which I almost hesitate to mention since me liking veggies means the rest or your food must be Wine - Oh my goodness Amazing What I craved after my dinner at Alinea was to come back for a night of fantastic wine baskets and baskets of the amazing bread donuts rolls and cheeses as unique as your wine Now that would be a perfect 5 stars,N

But it seemed the look not the concept of the dish is what they replicated Also the wines were a bit too sweet for my liking In general they seemed to pick underdog varieties and it was fun to hear why they were actually better than everyone thought they should be Despite my negative comments everything was very tasty and it was an interesting and fun dinner Im glad I experienced it,N

Ah the staff bring out burning oak leaves And somewhere in that mix sits a scrumptious pheasant dumpling with green grape and walnut nestled inside Now its time to use our hands to play with food ravioli skin + short ribs + olives + blackberry + smoked sea salt = the bomb Next is a shot of cold potato black truffle and butter Following that is a pigeonneau--thats squab prepared foie gras style and resting on top of a puff pastry--DELISH But my FAVORITE dish of the night had to be the Black Truffle explosion with hint of romaine and parmesan Let me tell you after eating this everyone at my table took a moment of silence to savor what they just experienced It was THAT good No joke Now that weve worked our way through the savory dishes its time to warmup to dessert by consuming a pineapple and ham infused crisp tastes like the best Hawaiian pizza youd have butterscotch and apple flavored smoked bacon and a caramel popcorn shot OUT OF THIS WORLD If that wasnt enough now on to the REAL dessert Earl Grey shortbread mixed with lemon curd pine nuts and caramelized white chocolate Bubble Gum straw with tapioca balls that you suck right out of the straw To Finish a fantastic chocolate dish with blueberry honey and peanut that just sets the mood right for the end of the night And to boot the staff took us on a tour of the 2-story 3-dining room space and of course I couldnt resist picking up Chef Grant Achatzs cookbook  If you couldnt tell by now this dining EXPERIENCE blew my mind--the best Ive had so far I cant recommend Aliena enough if you happen to be in Chicago Or you could do what I did and book your flight to Chicago around a successful reservation to Alinea Trust me its worth every dollar and youll spend a lot of dollars here Alinea does not disappoint I wish I could eat here every night,N

I pretty much have the trip planned this is going to be a foodie journey Alinea MotoBlackbird Avec Burts Place Perrys Silver Palm Super Dougs and then fly back home so Alinea is first the plan is to fly out the morning of the reservation get to the hotel freshen up relax and get ready for our special evening we can hardly wait So the morning of our departure we wake up late and miss our 630AM flight okay lets not freak out well standby hopefully we can get on the next one 10am nope 12pm nope2pm 4pm announcement next three flights to Chicago are canceled WHAT We have no choice but call the restaurant and cancel our special anniversary dinner  they are booked solid for the next three days that well be in townwe get a new flight for the next morning same timeand figure oh well maybe next time So we arrive on time and fly out we arrive relax for awhile walk downtown go to Perrys for an awesome Pastrami sandwich and my wife makes the obligatory trek to HM while were there I get a call from Alinea theyve had a cancellation for 630pm tonight its 330 I say YES and drag my wife out of the store and hurry back to the hotel so she can take her mandatory 2 hrs to get ready journeyfinally we make it had to cancel reservations at Avec but reschedule for lunch the next day So we arrive at the brownstone building with really nothing to identify it as Alinea other than a valet guy right outside we walk in to Star Ship Enterprises walkway I have no idea where Im going LOL we walk a few steps and a door to the left opens we are greeted by name at the door by the hostess and follow her to our table a bottle of wine is waiting for us as I had this arranged earlier Let the experience commence English Pea Shad Roe distillation of thai flavors Pork Belly Sturgeon King Crab Duck Hot Potato Tournedo Black Truffle Earl Grey Chocolate and bubblegum our menu AMAZING The best meal I have ever EXPERIENCED not had EXPERIENCED Dont think there is anything else I can say I will say this I cant believe it took me soo long to write my review I almost feel ashamed but I did it because after watching Andrew Zimmerns Bizarre Foods this past week and seeing him experience what we did when went its as if I relived the entire experience again The words he used to describe this place were 1000 exact Everyone must try Alinea,N

Definitely This meal is absolutely everything the other reviewers say We were lucky enough to have Grant Achatz in the kitchen the night we were there and also come around to make the desserts on the table My friend and I had wanted to try Alinea for some time and made our reservations about 3 months in advance The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and gives very thorough overviews of all of the food and wine The ambiance is beautiful without taking the attention from the food  There are enough reviews that highlight the food in a way I could not do it justice so instead of reviewing that again I will use my review to recommend reading Grant Achatzs book Life on the line before going as it tells the story of how the concept of Alinea came about the history behind the space and the menu his battle with cancer while he ran the restaurant and of course his love of food It is a quick read and really helps to make a dinner at Alinea all the more special Yes its an expensive meal but it is worth it,N

The starting price was about 60 for anything decent How understanding of them??? The first course was Sturgeon Roe covered with foam and I was seriously disturbed by the textures Small postules that popped in your mouth and screamed fish more than you would ever want or hope for One bite and I was done Actually I was seriously traumatized They noticed that both of us did not touch the first course and offered to bring us some thing else Humorouly enough after the dinner we realized that they just brought us the second course not something additional Go figure Hot potato cold potato was amazing thank goodness The next course was razor neck clams and scallops in a bunch of gelatinous goop with more foam which I now hate which could have been good without the creepy slimy textures So this restaurant is all about textures but it is about bad textures not good textures The rest of the courses were a mix of creepy slimy mayonnaise like textures One spoonful is tasty but cups of it become creepy and gross The highlights were the pork belly and Wagyu beef amazing and was almost worth the 600 dollar price tag of our dinner but considering that 9 out of 12 courses were creepy and gross I have to give it 2 stars Service was good but did not equal Charlie Trotters The popcorn course was exhausting and contained way too much mayonnaise type goop I did not get it and after dinner we made a pact to never do another multi course again for the rest of our lives  The dessert course were right out of a weird science fiction movie We had to suck weird things out of tubes it did not taste that good by the way Okay and then we have the bacon on a trapeze What was up with that? Silly to say the least These people spent money on a wire contraption to suspend the bacon like it was in traction The aromatic things were a waste of time I got yelled at for putting a dirty spoon on the pillow Summary was we would not go back if you paid us 600 dollars The decor was boring the food was creepy and the service was basic For the same money we went to Spiaggia the next night and were blown away Now that is a restaurant If I never encounter foam for the rest of life it would be too darn soon I am not sure why everyone loves this place Maybe they are not eating enough mayonnaise in their diets are are craving it immensely and that is why they love Ilinea I cannot figure out how everyone rates this restaurant a 5 because I do not see it  If you agree with this review we would love to hear from you I did not complain because after Trotters let down I gave up on expensive multicourses and really am over it P S The wine pairings were a joke I could have gone into their cellar and done an eeny meeny moe picking and come up with better wine pairings And that really pissed us off There were only two wine pairings that actually made sense the rest were a joke So the 12 year old was not very good and needs to go back to wine school and get a hair cut Yes my husband and I are spoiled brats and make better food in our kitchen every day If you are a truly serious foodie please do not waste your money on this restaurant,N

Not bad As for the great dishes Beans many garnishes pillow of nutmeg air This included a marshmallow and fruit leather centered around a navy bean puree which was topped with pancetta and a guinness beer foam Unforgettably rich Roasted pear foie gras candied fennel sweet spices It was like a cover of foie over a buttery soup and they poured more hot soup to melt it The tastes were totally harmonious Ive only ever had foie fresh at the foire du paris and so im picky about my foie but I loved this Caramel corn liquified Our servers presentation well this is intermission and what do you get at intermission? caramel corn Id heard bad things weird caramel corn shouldnt be liquified etc It was lovely smooth and tasted exactly like caramel corn but the aftertaste was great - not buttery or gross just faint and light Wagyu Beef black trumpets cedar branch aroma This bite of beef was SO amazing - Id fly to Japan for it Boyfriend insisted that the beans were still his favorite but when I pointed out it was merely a quantity comparison ie if he had less of the beans and more of the beef he acknowledged I was right Ice fish shellfish horseradish parsley One of my favorites with fried ice fish japanese delicacy sticking up out of a custard of shellfish and horseradish not at all spicy very very good with fried potato - like fish and chips except 34280785723094582 times better Short rib guinness peanut fried broccoli Imagine a sheet of guinness - even without it the braised short rib was amazing Fava beans lavender banana pecorino - i didnt love this so much as the BACON DONUT that came with it good lord almighty Lobster peas ramps mint vapor This might have been my absolute favorite had it not been for the slightly overwhelming peppermintspearmint smell Yet it was ridiculously tasty Strawberry violet nicoise olive holy gizmo quite literally An everlasting gobstopper mixed with willywonka technique of the gum that changed flavors in your mouth I dont even like olives but it was delicious and the layers melded together beautifully Hot Potato Cold Potato black truffle butter The server came out and I recognized it from pictures online OOOH its the potato he laughed yes This is such a signature dish and after tasting it I know why One of those few duets that complement each other in every way possible Temperature texture taste - all kicked ass and the parmesan cubes were wonderful Chocolate egg pomelo smoke Our favorite dessert hands down a pool of pomelo some valhrona chocolate infused with tea a chocolate brioche bridge a funky chocolate covered egg and smoke gel With 20+ dishes being served at a meal a few may not strike your palate perfectly but its definitely worth the trip Chef G and Co mess with tastes in completely unconventional ways and it is incredibly fun,N

The words perfect sublime delight and heavenly all come to mind But how does one truly describe a concept restaurant that conquers where others have failed or soars where others have become stale? I think the only way this restaurant can be adequately described is to discuss its wunderkind Grant Achatz Just over five months ago Achatz was diagnosed with mouth cancer Stage four mouth cancer at that And even if he survived the illness there was a great chance that he might lose his sense of taste Comparisons were instantly made to Beethoven but one could sense writers and compatriots where grasping at hope and praying just for survival This past Thursday I received a call from the restaurant to confirm Allie her parents and my reservation at Alinea After we had discussed the typical issues confirmation special requests food allergies etc I asked the caller about Chef Achatzs health I was prepared to receive a somewhat snide comment about the Chefs health being private or something similar Instead the caller thanked me Thanked me for asking And mentioned a press release which was put forth by the restaurant the previous week In the release which the caller mentioned the restaurant and Achatz finished with Achatzs own personal motto Onward So there I stood preparing to leave the restaurant on Saturday night prepared to receive my coat from the front-of-the-house staff when I looked into the kitchen Allies parents were wondering who Chef G was when I saw him Anyone who has been in or around restaurants can pick out the truly special chefs when they see them There is an aura to them Some have an air of power others are manic others are barking orders While I havent seen too many great chefs in action I knew Chef Achatz immediately He was the one who was moving slowly between the tables with an air of infinite calmness and purpose A man who had risen to the pinnacle of his profession only to be told he may die A man who had seen an empire rise only to hear prognostications that it may crumble as fast A man that had seen the end and knew that the dish he prepared or conceived of that night was not as important as other things  He had a wisdom in his movement that is not often seen among the young and even less seen amongst the uber-successful young He was a man frankly who had done more in the past 3 years than many do in 70-year lifetimes And despite his success and the money that he likely has and further the opportunity he likely had to walk away from it all there he stood Tenderly placing a sauce on his dish or preparing a foam for another dish Intensely calm Striving onward To Chef Achatz five stars are insufficient to truly describe your efforts in Alinea But despite the perfection you have created you strive onward  And for that like your staff so graciously stated I say thank you,N

Wrong It was a masterpiece Sweet Potato - How would you end such an extra extravagant affair but with flaming cinnamon stick with sweet potato pie tempura on the end lollypop style? It was crunchy and bourbony Youll notice that I used perfect a lot but in truth much of the dinner was just that perfect The service was wonderful the wine was great and the food was out of this world The creativity involved was inspirational and the valets were prompt Dont be intimidated by the food Be intimidated by the price We wereare and are planning on eating plain rice for a month to pay for our next trip If you want the unabbreviated version PM me,N

Nope theres a reasonIll get to it Overall I had an amazing experience It really is just that--an experience an event 4 hours with the most creative food I think Ill ever see in my life For instance I dont think Ive ever needed to be instructed on how to eat each course of a meal before  But before I get to the food let me just say that the ambiance was incredible Even just walking into the front door the hallway looks as if it narrows and shrinks just like in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Before you get to the end this magical door whooshes open and you enter the most beautifully lit room Soft purples reds and blues appear to creep up the walls Its immediately calming and exciting at the same time We did the full tour The sommelier recommended of course that we do the wine pairing but at 34 the cost of the full-tour there was just no way I could swing it So we opted for wines by the glass I felt as though my choice was not so subtly disapproved of but no further discussion ensued We started immediately with the Hot PotatoCold Potato and that was one of the most incredible things Ive ever tasted not to mention the little contraption it is upon arrival I wont go through all the dishes but will hit the highlights I thought the pear bite with olive oil and pepper was incredible It was presented in a bowl full of eucalyptus and inhaling while eating the pear was heavenly The waygu beef was delicious but it was just the coolest to have the aroma-dry ice-thing accompany the yumminess in my mouth The sweet potato on a smoldering cinnamon stick was just unbelievable as was the bacon on a wire I almost died with the lobster and popcorn cream and the Iberico ham dish which allowed the ham to begin almost melting over hazlenut deliciousness The service was impeccable and I really appreciated that they were not pretentious or judgmental They joked around and seemed to truly revel in the concoctions they were bringing to the table So why 3 stars? Well with just a few dishes left I found a hair in my dish The waiter was very apologetic and both full and a little grossed out I declined a replacement dish Another waiter promptly appeared and asked me if he could do anything else This was an incredibly awkward moment as I sure didnt want more food after 20 something courses but did hope they would offer some sort of gesture to make up for the hair He asked again what they could do and I realized they were putting me in the position of requesting a discount or some other accommodation I declined as I felt awkward and figured they would take care of it in some way as this didnt feel like the kind of haggling I should do in such a nice establishment Well when the check came there was no reflection of the hair and it was in essence ignored It felt too weird to raise the issue at that point and frankly ridiculous that it was on me to take care of it So we paid My friend left angrier than me and stated she would not return because of this Im still enamored with the rest of the experience so Im sure if I could afford it Id be back But it did leave a not so positive impression overall,N
5,22,2007,nNn5i,3Cn377NKRF_j2CysOIuZ4g,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,4,1,4,5,Wow Second best restaurant I have ever dined at This was the third attempt at dining at Alinea Our first two had to be cancelled due to last minute work conflicts So when the event finally came we were stoked Be warned there is no sign that we could see We drove past the place twice without finding it Finally we saw the valet sign and voila we were in The entrance is a little spooky It is a dark corridor that tapers narrower the deeper in you go We crept our way through the dark to the end and a sliding door a la Star Trek silently opened beside us and an immaculately dressed man greeted us warmly Very spooky indeed We were immediately let upstairs to our gigantic table for two in a sparsely decorated room that could be on the cover of Wallpaper magazine The main decoration were these space age lillies in glass vases with the Japanese rock embellishments The colors were all soothing browns and mauves to tone down the off white linens And guess what? The linens were actually MADE OUT OF LINEN Not cotton not silk not satin but LINEN What a nice touchThere was nothing but the linens adorning the table The wine menu was like a work of bloody Russian realist ficiton with 600 or more protaganists all of them larger than life itself most north of 80 per bottle I was a little too peckish and thirsty to read part one of War and Peace so we just ordered what the Sommelier suggested - a champagne cocktail made by mixing a boutique Champagne with just a smidge of sweet dessert wine Delicious The Sommelier pushed the wine pairings option which he describes as painstakingly matched to each course and rather than making a Tolstoyan effort at the wine list I decided to submit to our Sommeliers will The meal 14 courses all small many bite-sized but in whole just a little too much food which to me is the perfect amount Every dish was both a work of Art and a work of Science - in particular a work of Chemistry From the octopus nestled in a pillow of papaya with a spoon for a bed suspended above a bowl of warmed coconut-infused soy milk  to the black truffle juice someow stuffed to tightly into a ravioli that it literally explodes into your mouth when you bite it if you are not careful you spew it all over your date -- this meal is the yin and yang of dining Most of the courses are really beyond description and many of the flavor combinations I have never seen before - think bacon with butterscotch brie or avocado ice-cream chocolate and lemongrass apple and horseradish -- get the picture? The amazing thing is it all works Plus every course has a science gimmick -- such as your plate sitting on a pillow that has been filled with lavender scented air so that as you eat the weight of the pillow pushes the air out for you to smell with your food or a licorice cake that is somehow perfectly skewered on a flexible metal rod that somehow suspends just before your cake-hole so that you can just stick your face into it and have at it reminding you of the good old caveman days before knives and forks or like the magical chocolate ball that sat innocently in its bowl until the waiter poured hot white chocolate milk onto it and the top half AND ONLY THE TOP HALF of the ball melted away revealing a cross-section of outer chocolate crust a molten white chocolate lava mantle and a chocolate brownie core How the hell do they DO these things??? Service was almost on the casual side as the jocular waiters encouraged us to chow down on the licorice cake and use our fingers to rip into the bacon and butterscotch but at that place it works The Sommelier did not dissapoint - the parings were indeed perfectly matched But that brings me to why I dont like wine pairings There are always a bubbly course two to three white wine courses two red wine courses and one or two sweet wine courses Well call me caveman but I generally would rather have like eight bubbly courses or maybe eight red courses or maybe four and four I dont like sweet wine much and some white wines I just find boring So next time I will skip the pairing and instead Ill just get mediaeval on the 600 bottle wine list Finally I wish there was some kind of music even if it was almost imperceptable music A piano a string section something The restaurant was packed but it was so quiet you could hear the waiters at the other tables and you could hear everyone elses conversations So it made us self-conscious of our conversations If Im going to drop 600 for two people for dinner I dont want to feel embarrassed when I get loosened up and start telling my date about my Joan Jett fetish Other nice touches -- replacing the LINEN napkin with a new one every time you go to the rest room a different type of bread with each course custom made dinnerware designed around each course and at the end they bring you the printed menu for a keepsake A+,N

At times we longingly eyeballed the other patrons who were doing the 24 course tour who were presented with things like a giant log Umm I want to eat whatever delicious morsels off a giant log At the end of the meal they present you with a menu in a big black envelope That was a nice keepsake and reminder of the most amazing meal Ive had to date There were 2 downsides to my once-in-a-lifetime experience First I got chastised for taking pictures of my dishes Seriously? Okay I understand its kind of bothersome if youre using a flash but I turned off my flash and I told the woman that She said but your camera still gives off a light Dude Its a red blinking light that most peoples camera gives off if you dont use the flash like the red recording light when you use a video camera Hey were dropping some big money here its not like Im being a paparazzi and going flash crazy The table next to us had to leave early because the woman got drunk after her 5th course couldnt eat anymore was throwing her head on the table every 3 minutes and nearly stumbled down the stairs And they were frowning on me for taking pics even without a flash? Id say her demeanor in the nearly full room was much more distracting than my picture taking when it was nearly empty Secondly the staff was attentive so painstakingly attentive that it was almost borderline uncomfortable We could see them lingering at their waiting area talking about other patrons namely drunk woman and sometimes it felt like we were children at a library being observed by the librarian Still those two things did not detract from the experience that much and I cannot speak highly enough of Chef Achatzs culinary creations The Alinea experience brings food and eating to a whole new level,N

And the 24 course meal? forget it but each course was a delicate morsel of perfection to call it just food seems like an insult the combination of taste smell color textureit was more like an edible art exhibit that totally opened my eyes to how food can be prepapred now this is not the kind of dinner i want to have everyday perhaps once a year But certainly at least once in a lifetime Worth every penny All of you reading thisdont hesitate Just go youll be glad you did,N

It means scientific discipline involving the study of physical and chemical processes that occur in cooking Every dish was creative and complex We were impressed with the imagination and the detail that were delivered in each of the 14 courses Yep 14 courses Thank god we didnt do the 22 courses because I felt like my stomach was going to burst at the end of our experience One must be open to eating anything and everything and appreciate the flavors to truly enjoy this restaurant 1 Trout Roe with coconut hyssop passinofruit - sweet spicy salty 2 Tomato with basil mozzarella olive oil - tomatoes came in different forms hydrogenated jelly etc with a icy foamy mozzarella with cubed balsamic vingear jelly 3 Cauliflower with five coatings three gels apple - this is a seasonal dish There were 5 custard like cauliflower cubes Each coated differently parmasean almonds bacon dont remember the rest But you really have to use your palate to distinguish each one 4 Lobster with popcorn butter curry - yummy but a little too rich especially if you pop that butter balloon which my friend did = 5 Wagyu beef from Japan with maitake mushrooms smoked date and Blis Elixir - this was my favorite It was so flavorful that it kept me wanting more 6 ShortRib with Guiness peanut and friend broccoli - this was a big dish and we were only half way through our menu 7 Hot potato with cold potato black truffle and butter chives - it was a generous portion of truffle This was my friends favorite dish 8 Lamb with potato sunflower sweet spice - whew last of the savory dishes 9 Concord grape with yogurt mint and long pepper - the big ball was in a shot glass which we had to open wide The big ball cracks in your mouth and oozes out My friend almost choked on this one 10 Watermelon with fresh coriander tamari and bonito 11 Bacon with butterscotch apple and thyme 12 Pumpkin with gruyere Blis maple syrup - this was cool We ate this over a pillow of smoke so its like your eating a smokey dish 13 Chocolate with fig olive and pine - oh boy we cant eat anymore but we manage to eat it because its so good  Birthday chocolate ball  14 Dry caramel with salt - dried flakes of caramel that becomes chewy in your mouth Finally we made it through our meal I didnt even mention the breads which accompanied some of the courses such as the napa cabbage fennel bread or the oolong tea black sesame seed bagel We should get a prize for getting through the finish line though we were quite impressed with the couple behind us finishing up a 22 course menu Alinea also serves a very nice range of teas - one which was a imported 1947 tea that cost 95 for a cup of tea holy cow At the moment Alinea Manresa and Joel Robuchon Tokyo - Ebisu Garden location are tied on my restaurant list I think if Alinea served less rich dishes it would be the top of my list Were already talking about our next trip in the near future to El Bulli Spain and Fat Duck UK - I couldnt get a reservation when I was there this past August so next time I have to call exactly 3 months in advance which both serve molecular gastronomy cuisine Hopefully we can do New Orleans before that since my sister and her are craving crawfish - hhmm could just be a pregnancy craving for both of them so well see,N

SERVICE  The level of service is equal to the size of the hole in your wallet dining here leaves Table and chair pulled out for you every time appropriate utensils switched and placed in specific orientation for every course waiters that not only notice your actions but read your emotions There was one snootier waiter who seemed disappointed in me not the restaurant when I did not finish a course Another reviewer stated that the waiters will mirror your own attitude but I was intimidated and overwhelmed more than anything else I dont front baby Everyone else was great though Special mention for the sommelier I only drink to get drunk and my date does not imbibe at all but Im so glad our hosts did opt for the wine pairing There were about 6 or 7 wines and each one came with an anecdote of origin and character the whole table could share I wish every one of my meals could be served with a story And the sommelier was a red-head with a certified afro Love it An experience I will remember forever I recommend it for anyone in town who can afford it Celebrate there after you make it on Wall Street or get your sugardaddiesmamas lined up Youre gonna need em,N

Genius I realize the menu changes and this was on as of March 2007 but I hope its a permanent fixture I thought the wine pairing was well worth it and the sommeliers were obviously very knowledgeable and I appreciated that while they and the other service was solicitous it was not stuffy In fact Ive never heard so many random pop culture references made at a table at a formal restaurant The servers and sommeliers in fact appeared to be hipsters who happen to know a lot about food and wine Im not sure Id return any time too soon for one thing Im now broke but as I said from the start it is ranked as one of the top restaurants in the entire country and if youre interested in innovative cuisine you really should try it at least once,N

Im a fan of the long tour of tastes Execution is key just as with French masters but its not the same old sauces that heavily populate the worlds best restaurants I laugh when I eat Achatz creations and find myself craving them almost weekly 10 Although the techniques and flavors vary greatly from others in the culinary world Achatz definitely has his favorites that you will see reused many times Foams freezing gelatins tapiocas food delivery devicesand others are repeated frequently and loose their initial intrigue They are rarely used to the detriment of the flavor though as some gastronomic chefs will overlook So Ive heard of WD-50 OVERALL My favorite restaurant even compared to some of the European masters,N

If you are a lover of exciting dynamic and post-modern cuisine and live in the Chicagoland area -- make a reservation which youll need to do well in advance and go The next spring on April 5 my little personal historical marker of terrestrial position with respect to the sun we went back That time was notable in two extra ways first I did the wine flight along with the tour second I got a copy of the menu to take home as a keepsake a little thing I like to do sometimes -- call me sentimental I guess So I figured Id just share the menu and review it as best as I could remember bearing in mind that I was already up past my bedtime and was barely staying awake even as I type this before too much time passed and I lost the thread of it entirely I was far too tired that night to attempt such a herculean feat Even with memory fading it took all the free time I had over the course of two four days [Yelp has a 5000 character limit so I had to erase the dish-by-dish review from here] In short was this the best meal I had ever had? Absolutely not I have had meals of pure perfection at Charlie Trotters and Daniels Was this in the next level down? Absolutely Its a great experience with some stellar amazing wonderful exceptional food and some incredibly good dishes And one stinker that second time Was it worth the 175 tour price? Absolutely if youre into the finest kind of dining adventure Was the wine flight worth it? Yes but only on special occasions but then I dont drink much any more anyway In this case absolutely A memorable meal a nice evening a gorgeous room and building Oh and as opposed to last time this one only took four hours Record time I could have written more or found more links for the wines or any number of things but it had already taken a week and I felt like if I take any more time it might never get out So Id love to hear specific questions or feedback leave comments and Ill respond in kind This is a hybrid of two reviews I originally posted on 16 September 2005 and 12 April 2006,N

The aroma was heavenly Their allergy accommodations they made delicious substitutions and were careful to understand exactly what I could and could not eat The wine pairings all the wines are unique and have an interesting story behind them They dont seem to encourage it but one tasting is probably enough for two If you split it in two glasses they will probably charge you a little more because it will be 23 of what we usually pour instead of half and half  The sommelier is young with crazy hair I wanted to ask him what he put in his hair to make it stay like that but he grew on me because he is excited about presenting the individual stories of the wines He speaks colloquially like most people in their twenties do which makes him seem less formal and robotic than some of the staff I can see how the staff could come across as pretentious but its really just their job to guide you through the dining experience as it has been specifically designed in a fashion in keeping with the upscale atmosphere Bottom line If you can afford this luxury dining experience with no guilt you enjoy food and wine youre open to trying new things and wont pick out all the ingredients you normally dont like Ew I hate asparagus and sweetbreads I cant eat this and you understand that this is about more than just the food the pillow is for clean utensils and you drink the Thai flavors in a shot Roll with it then go and have an incredible time,N

Maybe because one of my dining companions was asking a lot of questions during the meal and the didnt want him distracting the chef?

It is hard sometimes to pack enough flavor in tasting portions since they are so small and I know chefs would season these dishes more heavily with salt to emphize flavors There was none of that going on here At Alinea the flavor of the ingredients shine and half way through the meal I raised my head and said Man this guys are not shy on flavors The food was fun exciting and emotionaly stirring My wife and I were giggling through the entire meal like little school girls We even got the chef to sign our menu fing tourists and tour the kitchen Our experience at Alinea was the highlight of our trip to Chicago  There was one thing though at the price we were paying for for a 12 course tasting menu 415 I was expecting a little more luxury ingredients But the interesting concept and execution of every dish more than made up for the lack of caviars and foie gras and abalone Thank you chef and staff for an amazing experience,N

In a way yes but I wish it was just 2 or 3 spoonfuls more Although I left Alinea full so I guess it is planned this way on purpose 11th - Pheasant green grape shallot burning leaf - the meat is on the end of a branch with leaves that smelled like they were likely burned This very pleasant perfume accompanies this tender flavorful bite of the meat 12th - short rib olive red wine blackberry - at the start of the meal the staff drapes this orange thing that looks like a fruit rollup over two black things that look like chopsticks They tell you this is for later Its pasta - a ravioli sheet They give you a board with the above ingredients and some others like black garlic and salt You put it all into your ravioli So delicious 13th - hot potato cold potato black truffle butter - you get a little wax bowl with a pin in it that holds cold potato elements You pull the pin from the bottom and it falls into the hot elements - quickly eat and savor the flavors 14th - pigeonneau - apparently its a very old classic dish executed exactly So just imagine a perfect flaky litttle tart crust with meat and cream and vegetable inside - small and wonderful Light not heavy - but rich tasting 15th - black truffle explosion - you bite this package on the spoon and this wonderful flavor of truffle explodes in your mouth the desserts of bacon carmel popcorn earl grey and chocolate were fantastic but I didnt care for the whole bubblegum suck out of the tube exeprience Total damage with wine and tip and tax was around 1100 Despite the muted overall experience the food the sommelier and being with my wife made it worth it Id most likely go back next time Im in town However I might skip the wine pairing as it was a bit too much for us Not so much me although I was pretty buzzed but my wife had a head-ache next day,N

2,20,2007,XgiIPHVfI,44_xlodSKEXM10DI9UEn7A,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,0,2,4,4,The four of us flew to Chicago from California one weekend for the express purpose of dining at Alinea  We opted for the 23 course tour menu Every element of the dining experience at this restaurant is carefully considered even your first steps into the restaurant When you enter the unmarked building you step into a long disappearing corridor There is an automatic sliding door which surprises you near the end of the corridor The dcor is modern and minimalistic There is no tablecloth on the table but as you will find out there are many many pillows that will show up throughout the dinner There are pillows for our bench seating There are little pillows upon which to rest your clean utensils There are even aromatic pillows that accompany a dish releasing the fragrance of juniper as it slowly deflates sitting under the weight of the dish Service is impeccable At least one waiter would stand unobtrusively in the background at all times to tend to our every need Our first course was a small bite sized croquette When one of my dining partners and I joked that we were going to be disappointed if we needed to go out for steak after dinner a waiter came by a minute later offering us bread When one of us started to fall behind in the 12 glass wine pairing the sommelier started to pour less and charged us proportionately less  The dishes I loved the most were dishes that paired together interesting and contrasting tastes but were not overly fussed with  For example the first course called croquette was a small croquette with cream and a garnish of steelhead roe I wasnt impressed with the idea of a croquette but when you pop it into your mouth the crunchy crust quickly gives way to an unexpectedly tender creamy interior shortly before the luscious oily roe pops over it all A good start Our second course was called octopus and consisted of a thin slice of octopus stacked with shiso flowers and papaya A small bowl of broth made from soy beans accompanied it The combination of flavors and textures was delicious and the broth chaser complemented the octopus well The dishes that I did not love and even disliked usually involved ingredients that were overly processed to the point where the attempt to extract the essence of the flavor resulted more often in ill tasting artificialness It was like you were eating a purple grape flavored candy as opposed to a fresh grape The worst dish representing this was a dish called short rib which included Guinness beer peanuts and fried broccoli Now I absolutely adore short ribs and beer so how could anyone mess this up? Heres how The chunk of short rib sat under a translucent square thin gelatin sheet presumably made of the Guinness Bits of peanut and burned broccoli were scattered about the dish along with mustard seeds  What I love about beer is that refreshing hoppy cool liquid taste sliding down your throat perhaps cleansing away the fatty short ribs you just ate Now take away the liquid refreshing tasty aspects of beer and what youve got left is that gelatin sheet The short rib lacked its usual rich fatty chewy texture and more resembled stewed meat Even the mustard seeds and burned broccoli had a monotonous bitter taste Not all the dishes need to be great but none of the dishes should bebad A disappointing surprise was that many of the dishes were over salted killing whatever flavor was underneath For example in a dish called hot potato the warmth of the hot potato released the mouth watering aroma of a black truffle slice and contrasted nicely with the chill of a cold cream potato soup but the whole dish was marred by the extreme saltiness of the soup At first we thought this was a fluke but several dishes had the same problem  On the plus side all the meats from the delicate seafood to the venison were cooked perfectly Also careful attention was paid to the texture of each element in the dishes a dimension I find is often ignored in many restaurants  Achatz techniques show their strength in the desserts Almost a third of the courses could be considered desserts which is more than I would have liked but they all had interesting combination of tastes that worked well with each other I loved the bubble encapsulating sweet ginger liquid in one of the desserts and I also loved the subtly flavored cube of shaved ice that contrasted with the creaminess of horchata pudding in another dessert The wines we drank One 12 glass wine pairing plus 2 bottles were all good though not remarkable The sommelier hinted as much when he mentioned that the wine was selected to complement the food not dominate it  Like the touristy dorks we are we asked for Grant Achatz autograph on our souvenir menu  He graciously complied for all four of us Thank You Grant Our total worked out to be 1200 before tip Youre welcome,N

My boyfriend made a comment about the white sauce on the plate only to realize it wasnt a sauceit was the plate The shiny white glistening plate that was clearly so perfect he mistook it for a sauce I replied to the waiter that my bf wasnt used to seeing plates so clean and that immediately broke the icethey liked us - they really liked us The service was impeccable - down to a piece of bread which had somehow fallen from my plate to the table but was so unworthy of a hand to pick it up they came back with utensils to scoop it up and take it away The first dish by far one of my favorites was the hot potato cold potato which has been spoken of in many other reviews One single sip of soup with a tiny potato speared at the head of a pin along with a single piece of chive butter and cheese So tiny but so deliciousa great start to a beautiful meal This dish was in Chicago magazine if I remember correctly and became the reason I had to come We are so grateful that Grant has recovered and survived his bout with cancer therefor giving us a chance to sit amazed and in awe of his talent over a 3 hour meal which we will NEVER forget When we finally walked out onto the street I felt like I had been on vacation It was a surreal experience with a lasting impression that I had become a tiny part of Willy Wonkas fantasy land,N

That left a bad taste in my mouth but I ultimately ordered the books on Amazon for less  and free shipping but no autograph o,N

He said dry  mediocre - I busted out laughing He informed me the better way to phrase that is what is the best way to have it prepared Soooo funny I got it steamed - at least I think - I was still laughing   CHICAGO DOG = soooo incredibly yummy I could eat one of these every visit I also ordered the Foie Gras dog I was excited about this one It sounds so interesting and I love trying new things But I have to admit Im on the fence about this one Id say Im about 80 like it - 20 - not quite sure what I think  Would I order it again? Yes Would I order it EVERY day or even once a week? Probably not But It was still very tasty - Im glad I tried it  FOIE GRAS DOG = Glad I tried and overall liked - but probably not my favorite My friend ordered the Sal Tessio OMG  TRY THIS It was so delicious But then Im a huge fan of spicy mustard LOVED IT  SAL TESSIO = Doug needs to come to my house  make this for me many times We also ordered duck fat fries Honestly I didnt think all that much of them  They were fine but that was about the extent of my thought on them My friend ended up eating most of them Again - glad I tried them but for me I would rather save room in my stomach to try yet another Hot DogSausage DUCK FAT FRIES - not for me GOOD just not for me  I am very glad we went Yes there was a wait but it seemed to go by quickly The food was fantastic It was fun to try new things and Doug was hilarious And the service staff was fantastic as well cant forget to mention them I definitely plan to go back - as often as I can  I cant wait to try rattlesnake someday,N

This is one of those places where it is worth it to wait in line for 2 hours I have been to Hot Dougs 5-7 times as I am right in the neighborhood If you are a first timer definitely try the foie gras but you probably only need half so try to split it with someone else In fact try to order as many sausages as you can handle and split them up because who knows when the next time you can wait in line for that long so pack it in and try as much as you can Try the duck fat fries if your there on Fri-Sat but again split them as they can serve 2-4 people per order Every item i have ever had here lives up to the hype I did have a kangaroo sausage one time and the texture was kind of funny When you finally get to the front of the line there is Doug ready to take your order who is a super friendly guy so dont worry about rushing the order There are somehow always seats inside Not sure how they figured out the table turnaround but it works Stay strong and dont leave the line,N

Im sorry Im not saying nobody needs a day off or that successful entrepreneurs can never take a vacation He should have a days off like everyone else I respect him for giving ALL of his workers Sundays off If he wanted to give them Mondays too more power to them I dont care that Doug himself or his workers take a week off thats not what I was going for he just has to have enough hired help to cover his business The restaurant business is not known for being able to drop off the face of the earth for a week at a time keeping a fair schedule is part of being in the industry especially for a restaurant that has been featured on the Travel Channel and regarded as Chicagos best and exists as more than a neighborhood favorite Please tell me am I wrong? I cant think of too many industries such as restaurant and retail who get to just take a week off without making customers mad And I think others had a right to know in case they ended up trying to go there in those eight days it wasnt like we just picked one bad day we wouldnt have made it the whole time we were in town I know things come up I would have been sympathetic with a needed DAY or two or even three off not eight or a reasonable excuse My son is getting married on the East Coast my grandma is in the hospital my wife is in labor etc  Or take a couple days off around one of the the other holidays in the other eleven months Take four days off for labor day nobody will question that   OR if you must take eight days less is more let us wonder if someone died or your kid is going to college or if youve got the plague For example We apologize we are closed and will reopen on August 15th The sign was not cute it was a huge slap in the face when wed been looking forward to it for so long Doug please let us give you the benefit of the doubt,N

Apparently each time I had the idea to go about 50 other people did too and the line was ridiculous I didnt even get out of my car those times I just kept on driving But this one lucky day on a Tuesday at 230pm there were only 8 people in line I dont eat beef or pork dont judge so I ordered one of the many chicken dogs and fries Delicious I think it would have been a 5 star experience if I tried one of the dogs they are really known for but I will extrapolate and say its all good Anyway some advice for your trip to Hot Dougs 1 Dont go on a weekend - unless you really really want duckfat fries only served on FridaySaturday 2 Avoid normal meal times - you will be hungry and angry and tired wayyy before you get a hot dog 12pm is an awful time to go even on a weekday 3 If its nice out the line will most definitely be longer Snow doesnt necessarily make the line shorter though 4 Maximize your experience by ordering a lot You never know when you might get back in 5 And apparently order corn dogs 6 Bring yo cash monies Enjoy ,N

I think its the bread Toasted lobster roll beats nondescript hot dog bun any day of the week Also I wish they melted the cheese onto the dog instead of serving it cold I had to try the foie gras dog which was as rich and fatty as it sounds The Chicken Cordon Bleu was recommended by Doug when I asked him to choose between that and the Elk sausage and it was good but didnt blow me away My friend had a delicious Chicken Rosemary sausage Their fries are handcut and served in huge portions Drink refills are free So yeah its really good But Id rather go to Franks n Dawgs which had no wait and sit on their backyard patio Glad I went though it can now be crossed off my Chicago bucket list Oh and Doug is as genuinely nice as everyone says,N

Youre in Chicago You can get the best hot dogs in the world pretty much anywhere Another commodity are Bratwurst and Weisswurst The original gourmet encased meat thats just not marketed correctly to the post-modern foodie Weisswurst Ground milk fed veal and minced pork belly sausage spiced with parsley lemon mace onions ginger and cardamom Served hot and topped with caramelized onions and stone ground mustard Sounds amazing right They serve it at most any German place,N

Not IME and definitely not if youre waiting 1+ hours As we were waiting in line someone heading out suggested that we get the saucisson so I saw it on the menu and ordered it It was a bacon sausage and was it was not my favorite - the sausage was way too tough and it wasnt juicy as it should be My bfs ribeye sausage hot dog was better and had add-ins that complemented it well but it wasnt amazing either We also split the foie gras and duck sausage topped with truffle aioli and foie gras mousse That one was better than expected but once again not worth the wait We also got the duck fat fries and I dont understand why everyone raves about them because they taste like your average fries I give them props for draining the oil well so that they werent greasy but a few were already slightly soggy by the time we got our batch,N

Studs Terkel and Mike Royko would spit down from above if they heard this So the moral of the story is if you want the quintessential Chicago experience dont go to any place where consumer driven hipsters are standing in long lines Real Chicagoans dont go to places like that for a hot dog Also Chicago isnt 98 percent white which should be another dead give away with respect to authentic or quintessential unless its a Cubs game Finally any place with Maui chicken or foie gras in their hot dogs? Not real Chicago And I doubt its really foie gras because its banned in Chicago so Id think PETA would be up in arms if a politically correct place like Hot Dougs broke that law Well actually it would make sense for a politically correct place like Hot Dougs to brake an anti cruelty law because thats what they do for a buck Now if you wanna the best Polish in Chicago go to Sams Red Hots on the Armitage just remember no one has ever died from eating there and the Latin Kings and Insane Unknowns on the corner are far more entertaining than jabbering hipsters with captions over their heads that read Empty,N

Chicago - Awesome The pickle the snap of the dog I want one right now  Chicken  Gruyere - Melts in your mouth into a puddle of cheesy deliciousness Also Awesome  Elk - Great flavor but a bit drier than the perfectly oozing dogs above  Andouille - If my local market did this as well Id have sausage weekly Tasty but not for me  Duck  Fois Gras - Its rich its tasty but while I like it Id much rather have 4 of the Chicago dogs And due to the price differential I can have that for the same price Protip They can prepare any dog as charred fried and grilled deep fried or steamed The charred versions seemed tastier even compared to a fried and grilled dog They do a great job with that preparation so Id go with it Fried and grilled is a close second Also Doug was awesomely friendly despite the fact that we had very little idea what we were doing He seemed genuinely surprised that our group came all the way from PA and Kentucky to eat his dogs She says I always thought the expression foodgasm was weird and slightly scandalous -- but the first time I bit into a hot dog here Chicago I had one It was incredible The dog was juicy delectable and charred just right perfectly dressed To this day Hot Dougs is the only place to have ever given me a foodgasm  Doug knows his meats Be sure to enjoy the basics as well as try some unusual to me game meats I second my guys preferences above,N

Ok I know I didnt come in on a duck fat day but I can only imagine how delicious they must be These regular fries were just crispy enough and delicious I would consider myself lucky to have waited less than half an hour to eat at Hot Dougs I would easily wait another hour to taste this deliciousness again Upon leaving I was almost moved to make the same proclamation as that man said upon my entrance,N

We had the chicken mole sausage spicy and some alligator Weve had the regular hot dog a few times All really good Not fans of the andiuolle sausage The prices are reasonable considering what you get think about Dougs prices next time you order food at a Chicago festival Finally had the duck fat fries They were good fries but I guess my taste buds arent sophisticated enough to differentiate what makes them so special I like to cover my fries in ketchup anyways Well of course be back for the whole experience - again and again This might be the only restaurant we eat at over the next several months seeing how much a wedding costs ,N

Start out at a Chicago Dog or an Italian Sausage work up to the Hot Dougs BLT and graduate with a Foie Gras I will be very very sad yet it will be very bittersweet if it ever disappears from the Chicago dining scene I personally am of the opinion it is in the top three maybe top two restaurants in the City of Chicago With a 2730 Zagat score its also in the top ten in the country Hot Dougs is significant and should not be ignored All in all this is absolutely my favorite place to enjoy food and I literally tell everyone I meettalk to about food about it Its just too perfect When I sit down at the table at the end of my life and balance out the accounting books everything will come up completely even partially because of Hot Dougs I feel so complete because I have enjoyed going here so much It should be a bucket list item for anyone Absolutely perfect In every way,N

Id rec the Foie gras with duck sausage which is amazing The yak was also fantastic had a nice beefy flavor makes sense since after all its a long-haired bovine found throughout the Himalayan region of south Central Asia courtesy Wikipedia The rattlesnake was also really good somewhat sweeter flavor w less of a meaty flavor Honestly Id just ask the owner what roughly you want beefy juicy smoky gamey strange and hell help rec one or two French fries were natural cut great Cheese fries would be excessive as theres a good amount of cheese on many of the specialty hot dogs Cash only Closed Sunday and closes at 4pm For more details check out my food blog at wait at here on Yelp Come on Yelp gimme some IPO shares,N

Unless youre Californians you should always have cash WE ARE CALIFORNIANS He laughed at the coincidence and told us to order whatever we wanted and he would only charge us 20 Needless to say it was the most delicious hot dogs Ive ever had The Foie Gras was definitely my favorite and I highly recommend it for all you duck lovers out there,N

Unbeknownst to me the week we traveled to Chicago Chi Town was hit with a heat wave with sweltering unimaginable hot temperatures However I wasnt to be deterred by 100 degree temperatures Since we were staying on Michigan Mile it was a bit of trek to check out Hot Dougs I decided to stop by after my lunch at Sabri Nihari on Devon Avenue both on North West side Now all of us were already carbed out with our IndianPakistani luncheon My son such a trooper shared my enthusiasm for Hot Dougs We reached Hot Dougs a bit after 3 pm in our cab To my surprise there was still a long line out the small shop Did I make the right call? Should we wait in this heat? Well after all we were already there Why not? The wait in line gave us the time to decide from the multitude of choices facing us I had to make my decision wisely since only 2 of us were willing to taste and share I ordered the classic Chicago Dog and the glutton in me picked Foie gras and Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli and some Fries Note the Duck Fat Fries are only made on the weekends Incidentally it is a cash-only counter One bite of my Foie Gras and Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli I was literally in decadent hog heaven Yes It was absolutely worth it And my snooty ass will withstand any long line for another bite any time I wish I had the appetite to try their other game concoctions but there is always the next time A well deserved iconic addition to the Chicago Culinary scene Hot Dougs is a MUST for all foodies and lovers of encased meats,N

No clue I mean I really love sausage more than the average person I blame my German heritage for that but these are the best sausages I have ever had When I went I ordered the Ribeye Steak Sausage with Chimichurri Crispy Fried Onions and Carrigaline Farmhouse Cheese and I ordered this Portuguese linguica sausage with some kind of smoky cheese on top The ribeye steak sausage was very good but the Portuguese linguica sausage OH MY GOD I need a new paragraph just to describe this sausage Im not sure if it was the sausage itself that was so good or the combination of it with that smoky cheese but this was seriously the best encased meat meal I have ever experienced I dream of this sausage And Hot Dougs has now become my benchmark for all things sausage-related I also tried the duck fat fries and thought they tasted like nothing special Someone I was with bought the normal fries so we could compare and yes you can taste a difference but nothing substantial I would recommend just getting sausages and no fries Save room for the good stuff As far as the wait goes we got there at 1045am on a Friday and only had to wait about a 10 minutes wait which I know is unusual Ive driven by this place on the weekend and seen the line stretch for blocks I cant wait to go back - these sausages are worth a 2 hour wait in the Chicago winter,N

In this world of hungry children and failing economies and corrupt governors did this specialty dog warrant the 9 price tag the commute and the lines? Hm I dont know I dont think so Firstly I will say its very very good It was definitely duck flavored and good combination of flavors and I dont regret at all coming here and trying it once However here were a few thoughts I couldnt help thinking 1 Was this the best hotdog I ever had? Maybe but I cant say for sure because this is a unique specialty dog So it didnt really fix my traditional hotdog crave nor did it fix my foie gras crave I like mine grilled 2 Was it worth 9 and perhaps a wait? It was definitely worth 7 and a short wait And definitely 5 I am dreaming obviously and an hour wait at that price I would order 2 for sure 3 Its hard for me to give any place 5 stars that didnt blow my mind or affordable enough for me to visit regularly 4 Hm smaller than I imagined thats what she said Take friends and family? Sure Try at least once? Totally Regular spot? I dont think so Still very very very good,N

But once we got inside the doors and the delicious odor hit our nose holes all I can say is Wow The encased meats as they prefer to be called range in price from about 3-4 for the standard fare to 8-10 for their weekly specials And while the original Chicago Style dog with everything of course is top notch the money is in the specials As the name weekly specials implies the specials change weekly But no matter what is on the list Id suggest focusing on those Youll have a little time to browse the menu once you wait in line inside the restaurant but its not a bad idea to prepare by checking out the menu online Keep an eye out for the game of the week under the jackalope While there my group of friends sampled rattlesnake yak jalapeo duck kangaroo and their 40-sausage chili The chili was rich and meaty with a great smoky taste Highly recommended Each special sausage has its distinct characteristics and its hard to go wrong with any of them They were all good but the favorite of all the types we got was the rattlesnake  As an added bonus on Fridays and Saturdays they serve their famous Duck Fat fries These were great tasting but came out a bit limp and I wouldve preferred them a crispier But still good enough to get them again The order is big enough to share between a few people Service-wise Doug is great as well as the rest of the staff Theyre welcoming helpful and all really seem to enjoy working there,N

Nowhere In my opinion its a must do at least once when in Chicago Once you get inside you will be helped by Doug himself who is very cool And when you get inside it will make sense as to why he has you wait outside for so long Its not very big inside So the good news is once youre in and youve ordered theres always a place for you to sit and you get your food in about 5-10 minutes Theres a method to his madness Personally my focus is on the specials Im sure everything on the regular menu is great but what sets this place apart are the crazy concoctions he dreams up We had 1 Saucisse de Toulouse with Dijon Goat Butter Pate de Campagne and Creme de Brie Cheese Amazing Our favorite of the day  2 Taco pork sausage with green chili mayo and queso asadero My boyfriend did not like it but I did It wasnt as original as some of the other selections but it was quite tasty I did have to take off some of the cheese though 3 Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel This was the boyfriends pick and he really liked it although he preferred 1  We also had the duck fat fries and this might be totally sacrilegious to say but I dont get their notoriety Neither does my boyfriend They taste a little better than regular fries but they did not make the earth move or the sun shine a little brighter or even make me swoon a little So next time Im in town I might hit up Hot Dougs when they are not available and maybe wait 15 minutes less in line  Personally I didnt find it difficult to get here by public transportation We took the blue line to California and then took the 52 bus which drops you off right in front  Given that the bus drivers in Chicago think they are starring in their own private version of Speed we got there in like 10 minutes from the train station There isnt much else around here though which is a bummer unless you count Kumas Corner And if you can eat at both in one outing you need to be calling Adam Richman,N

Yeah I want a City lunch We agreed on Hot Dougs The line was not too terrible the rain kinda sucked but when in Rome I ordered a chicken sausage sante fe style with duck fat fries Yum My husband had whatever came with fried plantains Wow - plantains really do make everything better Soda has unlimited refills Thanks I liked that there was enough seating The counter guy was great all servers were polite helpful and professional,N

Maybe its because my friend was hungover from the previous evening and couldnt really eat the food? Either way Im not running back again - but go if you have half a day to spare in the city,N

Will someone hold my spot? Where is there an ATM?? And I call myself a pro Yelper How could I let this happen? Ok get a grip I think to myself The fois gras dog is listed as 9 tax included in all listed prices Ill just get a cup of water to go with it I get to the front of the line and there he is Doug himself taking orders in his hipster glasses and tshirt I mention something casually about only having enough cash for a foie gras dog and he INSISTS that I get fries and a fountain drink with it refusing to charge me for the fries and drink Hes all like you waited in line you came all this way you gotta try some fries What?? This is a rare Tuesday miracle But thats just the kind of guy Doug is and thats the kind of place this is So long story long I would make a trip to Chicago just to come back here And I live in New Orleans Wow,N

Las Tablas offers an array of tasty entrees highlighted by the signature dish Matrimonio which celebrates the marital bliss of tender steak and seasoned chicken Several seafood options can also be found on the menu Many feature South American style shrimp Each entree is easily sufficient for one person with tasty Columbian favorites yuca and plantains alongside But for a group of four sharing three of the main courses should leave everyone satisfied The tables outside the restaurant make for an enjoyable evening during the summer yet they arent necessarily large enough to hold everyones small plates along with the entrees Service appears to be acceptable Although in our group there was a forgotten salad which finally arrived after the entrees Also when it was time to pay the waiter suspiciously disappeared But overall Las Tablas is certainly a nice find in South Lakeview Its BYOB and the meal is reasonably priced Ole,Y

The wait between courses was excessive for the number of tables occupied Because the waitress from our first visit had given us a heads-up that the Red Velvet Cake takes quite a while to make we ordered it before our entree arrived Or so we thought Turns out this waitress either didnt understand why we were ordering the cake ahead and didnt bother to ask anyone else about it or she completely forgot about it So when she came up after dinner and asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu I reiterated that all we wanted was the piece of cake She didnt mention not having ordered it -- until maybe 10 minutes or so later and then she said it would be a few minutes yet After entertaining our 2-year-old son for another 15 minutes or so still no word on the cake so we finally just asked for our bill Im not entirely sure what the floor management was doing this entire time -- either they were not paying attention at all or they just didnt care With 3 occupied tables in the restaurant Im not sure either option is at all acceptable There was a guy with a chefs shirt on sitting at the bar this whole time and I have to assume he could have done something if he cared but he seemed to be more interested in sending the busboy to neighboring restaurants to spy on how many customers they had The waitress muttered an apology a couple of times but of course that didnt really help Its a shame because the food really is good but I cant take the chance that were going to go through this again Good food can still cause indigestion when the experience is like this was,Y

For an extra 10 bucks I could have gotten a decent filet elsewhere I dont even know what I was thinking going into this place After all its JUST a pos skirt steak Oh and it came with a bland half-a-potato and yuca The plantain was tasty thoughService and ambiance were good Nothing to bitch about hereOverall I would not go back and would not recommend Las Tablas Tango Sur blows this place awayand they have Filets,Y

I quickly got over my slight claustrophobia and settled in nicely We had many questions as we were not familiar with Southern Coastal cuisine and our server was not only knowledgeable but extremely patient and kind as we took up a lot of his time We were told of several specials that ran out his mouth like hed been saying them for years  without even a peek at a special card We started out with some specialty cocktails All were goodtook a little long but a bit on the stingy side for the price On his recommendation we ordered the pulled pork grit cakes and the potato  herb fritters for appetizers Both were absolutely delicious and set our stomachs up for much anticipation For our mains we ordered three of the specials Soft shell crab w corn bread stuffing pork chop w spicy mashed potatoes and okra and seared scallops w ratatouille and asparagus My husband had the braised pork hock We asked for wine recommendations and were sold on our servers advice Prosecco for me and my girlfriend and a delicious red wine blend for our husbands All of the entrees were incredible and were paired beautifully with our libations Although we had no intention of sharing we simply had to because we felt guilty not allowing each other to experience such heavenly treats We finished the evening off with a rich  dense red velvet cake which was perfectly executed To say WOW about Big Jones would be a great understatement This little Andersonville star is not to be missed And by far the best server in all of Andersonville We will be back and we will be sitting in Dannys section We loved it,Y

Well my little one eats everything but if he doesnt like it then he would just spit it out Everything we give him he wants more and more Now as for my older one hes very picky and doesnt try out new food unless we give him some thing to drink So weve tried some meat dishes and fried rices and guess what he loved and ate everything So overall you get the point you want good Pho or even just want viet food? go here you wont be disappointed,Y

It didnt taste good at all It might have tasted like pee but fortunately I dont know what pee taste like I did not like it at all Then our soup came I was a little nervous but when I tried it it tasted pretty good I have to say But the noodles were rice noodles instead of egg noodles My dads broth was so much better than mine It tasted almost minty in some ways It was a seafood broth Then I tried the bean sprouts and they were not too bad I have to say That concludes my review for today     Stella,Y

Im not gonna say nothin bad about Chicken Hut All Im gonna say is we got more Flavor After my initial pizza marathon I had to try it More flavor indeed I hold their chicken in the same high regard as their pizza - my favorite in the city You get an expertly seasoned quarter chicken two sides pita and a drink for about 6 bucks total My favorite sides would be the potato salad and the black beans but again theyre all good I would get the chicken every time but am usually seduced by one of the slices they have readyThe Salad Huge Fresh Ive only tried two of these but they definitely stand up to my voracious appetite Very nice juicy grape tomatoes and top quality cheeses Both times I got it in a fresh baked bread bowl My technique eat half the salad with a fork Eat the other half wrapped in the bread bowl like some kind of giant taco Probably enough food for two people or one really hungry guyThe Staff Very good people Family owned so you know they care about what theyre doing Everyone there is very friendlyExtras Brazilian music Brazilian TV sometimes sportswinter Olympics lately and they have a charity event every TuesdaySo in conclusion High quality fresh ingredients family owned a great value and a good vibe Thats why I dont go grocery shopping anymore,Y

And then you discover that youre in front of a bunch of metal albums and you dont really listen to metal you really want to find this old folk album from the 1990s and you dont know where the folk section is and you get really nervous because those surly hipsters are still casting frown rays onto you and you suddenly feel like the stupidest lamest person on the planet and so you either leave without buying anything or grab the first thing that you see and take it home and never open it?This place is just like that record store except its a restaurant The foods definitely decent but the angry eye rolling hipster staff really take away from the overall experienceI usually order to go in advance,Y

The manager decided that it was appropriate for her to not charge us for the hair roll Instead she said everything else is fine and refused to accommodate us in any other way and augured with us for 3-5 minutes Additionally I ordered a pear martini and a dead ant was floating at the top of the beverage I have reported Wakamono to the city of Chicago health department better business bureau and BBB food inspector The lack of respect courtesy and appropriateness towards their customers is disappointing I would not recommend eating here any further,Y

Oh and if customers come up and ask if there is place to hang a coat and youre the host doing absolutely nothing take the coat and hang it up If youve tried their sister restaurant across the street Ping Pong you know what a bad host looks like Cmon people its called a service industry for a reason,Y

As for the milkshake it was nothing special plus wayy too thick i couldve had a better one from McDonalds or Wendys This place is really not worth the hype unless you like over paying for a slice of reheated pizza cant speak for the rest of there menu items since i havent tried it however my first visit really didnt impress me,Y

Starbucks and book stores allow people who order one drink or even nothing to sit at a table for hours and hours even when they are busy Unfortunately though the manager at least listened to us and was not rude per se he didnt do a good job at all of addressing our concerns or think outside the box and take the common sense approach to try and understand and make us feel like valued customers,Y

We were happily talking until then and this manager guy comes and tells us to leave without explanation about miscalculated change? Whoa watch your attitude That manager guy stood until my friend signed and took the receipt right away and left We got soooooooo mad instantly at his attitude because there is no reason to hear sign and go I assure you that we hardly made any noise while we were eating and it was HIS miscalculation of the cash change Our server told us that he the manager gives change to the servers  Four of us got very mad and went to front side and talked with the other manager He was lightly apologizing and then he says  what do you want me to do? we are busy     unbelivable What do you think we want? just one sincere apology from the other manager It was pointless talking to those people so we just leftI would of course NEVER EVER go back there and maybe I would never go eat at any other Giordanos They hire horrible managers,Y

I will say that when I walked in I really liked the ambiance and liked that it was intimate However once it gets really busy then you have waiters busboys and patrons bumping into you the whole night because its pretty tight One of the reviewers I had read said their waiter had zero personality And thats who we got Im not sure this should be his desired way to make a living because he clearly didnt seem to enjoy it The food was pretty good nothing special and very small quantities for the price The busboy took our water bottle away a table of 7 people before the main course arrived and never brought it back It wouldnt have been too bad if I had the glass of wine I had ordered but that was never brought either The waiter apologized an hour later as we were paying asking if I wanted it now Seriously?? Even my fellow diners had to grab the waiter to ask for more drinks he never came back during a two and a half hour dinner to ask The host had to actually go get us more water before we finished Now that I think of it the waiter and bartender could probably keep up with the orders if they werent doing kitchen duties like plating appetizers or cutting bread for the bread baskets The poor bartender looked like she was going to pass out because she was trying to fill all the drink requests and make appetizer plates for the whole restaurant Im thinking maybe once theyve been open for a while they will get their bearings then someone told me theyve been open for 5 years Wow I dont think Ive had that uncomfortable of a dining experience in the 15 years Ive been in Chicago Maybe it would be a better experience to go during a weekday when its not busy But with those prices there are so many better options along Clark Street where you get the service you deserve,Y

Being in the Industry myself the staff did an amazing job From our waitress to the hosts bar staff and back of house the staff was definitely on top of their game Especially for how crazy busy they were It pains me to see bad reviews on this establishment especially over this past weekend with the craziness that is St Paddys weekendFirst off youre in an Irish Pub on St Paddysof course the music is going to be loud Youre in a BAR on one of the biggest party days of the yearAnd secondly if youre old enough to drink in a bar you should be old enough to figure out how to split your own bill Maybe next time your big group goes out you should all bring cash to avoid the confusion of adding your 250 coke and your burger on your cardHands down one of my favorite places to dine drink and chill in ChicagoHighly recommend to everyone,Y
